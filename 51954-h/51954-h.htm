      CHAPTER ONE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne forenoon, in
      the winter of the great storms that swept the Pacific States, Adrian
      Wilder, a tall, slender, dark young man, stood in front of his stone hut
      on a shoulder of Mt. Shasta and watched the assembling of the elemental
      furies to do their savage work in the mountains. By all the signs that he
      had learned he knew that mighty havoc was to be done; but he did not
      foresee, nor did the oldest residents of that wilderness, that this was
      the beginning of the most memorable winter of terrors known to the white
      man&rsquo;s history of the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong sense of security and comfort filled him as, turning from the
      gathering tumult about him, he studied the resistance of his hut. He, with
      Dr. Malbone&rsquo;s help, had built it from foundation to roof, using the almost
      perfectly shaped blocks from the talus of the lofty perpendicular basalt
      cliff at whose base he had built his nest that summer. With nice
      discrimination he had selected the stones from the great heap that
      stretched far down from one end of the shelf upon which he had built; with
      mud he had fitted the stones to form floor, walls, arched roof, and
      chimney. With boards and a window-sash borne by him up the mountain from
      the road in the canon he had fashioned a window and doors. By the same
      means&mdash;for the shelf was inaccessible to a wagon&mdash;he had brought
      furniture, books, provisions, and fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hut was strong and comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should snow fall to a great depth, he could easily shovel it down the
      steep slope of the canon. Should an avalanche come,&mdash;that made him
      wince. Still, he had made calculations on that account. By arching the
      roof of his hut he had given it great strength. Better than that, should
      an avalanche plunge over the edge of the cliff it must first gather great
      speed and momentum. Stretching back mountainward from the top of the cliff
      was a considerable space nearly level; an avalanche descending from the
      higher reaches of the vast mountain would likely stop on this level
      ground; but should it be so great and swift as to pass over, its momentum
      would likely carry it safely over his hut, as the water of a swiftly
      running stream, plunging over a ledge, leaves a dry space between itself
      and the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why think of the avalanche, with its crushing, burying snow, and, far
      worse, its formidable bowlders that could annihilate any structure made by
      men? It were better to think of the comfort and security of the hut, and
      listen to the pleasant music of the little stream at the base of the
      cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better still was it to view the coming onslaught of the elements; to note
      the marvellous coherency of the plan by which their destruction was to be
      wrought; to observe how the splendid forces at play worked in intelligent
      harmony to shape a malevolent design. To a man of Wilder&rsquo;s fine
      sensibilities, every fury unleashed in the gathering tumult seemed to be
      possessed of superhuman malignancy of purpose and capability of execution.
      The furious wind that came driving down the canon lying far below him was
      the breath of the approaching multitude of storm-demons. The giant trees
      on the slopes of the canon seemed to brace themselves against the
      impending assault. Behind the wind, filling all the sky with a gray
      blanket that darkened away to the source of the wind, was the silent,
      stealthy snow-cloud, waiting to follow up and bury the havoc of the wind,
      and finish the destruction that the wind would begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      From contemplation of this splendid spectacle the young man&rsquo;s thoughts
      turned to the dangers with which the storm threatened the mountain folk,
      most of whom were engaged in the lumber traffic. Would any of these be cut
      off from their homes? The rising rage of the wind indicated the closing of
      all the roads with fallen trees: would that bring serious hardships to
      any? In the summer, now past, the environs and flanks of Mt. Shasta had
      sparkled with the life and gayety of hundreds of seekers for health and
      pleasure,&mdash;the wealthy thronging a few fashionable resorts, the
      poorer constrained to a closer touch with nature and the spirit of the
      vast white mountain; but they now were gone, and the splendid wilderness
      was left to the savage elements of winter. Had any delayed their leaving
      and were at that moment in the drag-net of the storm?
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, there was Wilder&rsquo;s one close friend in the mountains, Dr.
      Malbone, who, like Wilder, had left the turmoil of city life to bury
      himself in these wild fastnesses. They had known each other in San
      Francisco years before. For five years the scattered people of the
      mountains had employed the services of this skilful physician, and had
      come to trust and honor him in the touching way that simple natures trust
      and honor a commanding soul. It was Dr. Malbone who had so wisely assisted
      in the building of the stone cabin at the foot of the cliff. It was he who
      had explained the principle of the arch to the younger man, and had shown
      him how to bend and place the supports of the growing arch until the
      keystones were fitted in. It was he who had explained the mysteries and
      uses of ties and buttresses. What would Dr. Malbone do in the storm? What
      risks would he run, to what hardships be exposed, in visiting his
      patients? Only a few miles separated these two friends, but with such a
      storm as was hastening forward these few might as well be thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far up the canon Wilder heard the first fierce impact of the storm, for
      the heavy crash of a falling tree sounded above the roaring of the wind.
      By walking cautiously out to the extremity of a point that projected from
      the shelf upon which his cabin stood, he had been accustomed to see the
      snowy domes of Mt. Shasta. He knew that the storm sweeping down the canon
      was but a feeble echo of the mightier tumult on the great father of the
      north. In the hope that he might see something of this greater battle, he
      now made his way to the extremity of the point, the wind making his
      footing insecure; but only broad slaty clouds were visible in that
      direction, transmitting the deep rumblings of the hurricane that raged
      about Mt. Shasta&rsquo;s higher slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while standing on the extremity of the point that the young man,
      turning his glance to the deep canon beneath him, beheld a thing that
      filled him with alarm. At the bottom of the canon, the Sacramento River,
      here a turbulent mountain stream, and now a roaring torrent from the
      earlier rains of the season, fumed and foamed as it raced with the wind
      down the canon, hurrying on its way to its placid reaches in the plains of
      California. The crooked road cut into the hither slope above the
      high-water level of the river was not the main highway running north and
      south through the mountains; it served the needs of a small local traffic
      only. Wilder felt both surprise and apprehension to observe a light wagon
      driven at a furious pace down the road, flying before the storm. The
      incident would have been serious enough had the wagon, the two horses, and
      the man and woman in the wagon belonged to the mountains. The horses were
      of fine blood, and were unused and unsuited to the alarming situation in
      which they now found themselves; the wagon was too elegant and fragile for
      the mountains in winter; and even at the distance that separated its
      occupants from Wilder, he could see that they were filled with a terror
      such as the mountaineers never know. The man was driving. Instead of
      proceeding with caution and keeping the horses perfectly in hand, he was
      lashing them with the whip. A man used to the mountains would never have
      been guilty of that folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that they were heading down the canon for the main road,
      still some miles away, by following which a little further they would
      arrive at a station on the railway. Pieces of luggage in the rear end of
      the wagon indicated that the travellers must have been spending the summer
      or autumn in the remoter mountains, where some beautiful lakes offered
      special charms to lovers of nature. Obviously their departure had been
      delayed until the approach of the present storm drove them hurriedly away,
      to be overtaken here in the canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roaring of the wind, the surge of the torrential river, and, worst of
      all, the trees that were now crashing down, might have bewildered the
      steadiest head not trained to the winter savagery of the wilderness. A
      single tree across the road ahead might have meant disaster. Except for
      the little stone hut of Adrian Wilder, placed purposely to secure as great
      isolation as possible, and invisible from the road, there was no shelter
      within miles of the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the catastrophe came. The man, evidently seeing just ahead a
      tree that was swinging to its fall, shouted to the horses, and laid on the
      whip with added vigor, aiming to pass before the tree should fall. The
      horses, wholly beside themselves with terror, reared, and then plunged
      forward; but a moment had been lost. The horses and wagon passed under the
      falling tree just in time to be crushed and buried under it. The thunder
      of the fall echoed above the roar of the wind and the crash of more
      distant falling trees. Nothing of the four living things that had passed
      under the trap remained to Wilder&rsquo;s view; they had been as completely
      blotted out as though they had never filled a place in the great aching
      world.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWO
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR a moment the
      young man gazed in a stupid hope that the impossible would happen,&mdash;that
      horses, wagon, man, and woman would emerge and continue their mad flight
      down the canon. Then, so completely and suddenly had all this life and
      activity Ceased, he wondered if the old anguish that had driven him to the
      solitude of the mountains was now tricking an abnormal imagination and
      weaving phantasms out of the storm, to torture him a moment with
      breathless dread, and then suppress themselves in the seeming of a tragic
      death. He remembered the warnings of Dr. Malbone,&mdash;he must close his
      mind upon the past, must find in the present only the light with which the
      world is filled, and must aim for a sane and useful future.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this consumed but a moment. At once there burst upon him the awful
      reality of the tragedy that had worked itself out so logically before him.
      Humanity cried aloud within him. He sprang toward his hut, procured an
      axe, and plunged down the slope of the talus, taking no heed of the crude
      but surer trail that he had made from the road to his hut. He slipped,
      fell, gathered himself up, fell again, but rapidly neared his goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused when he had reached the prostrate tree. Through the branches his
      peering revealed a crushed, still heap. He pushed his head and shoulders
      within and called. There was no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at the rear of the wagon, and soon saw that it had been crushed
      into an indeterminate mass of wood and iron. By pushing apart the more
      yielding branches he brought to view the up-turned face of the man, whose
      eyes, fixed in death, stared horribly from a head curiously and
      grotesquely unshaped by the crush of the branches. The young man drew
      back. He gasped for breath; he called upon his self-command to bear him up
      in this strenuous time. He attacked the branches with his axe and cleared
      them away. He half wondered that the eyes of the dead remained open while
      they filled with particles of the bark riven by the axe. Presently the
      body came within reach. With unspeakable repulsion the young man placed
      his hand upon the stranger&rsquo;s chest. There was no sign of life. Indeed, he
      wondered that he had taken any trouble to ascertain what he already knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the young man&rsquo;s dread and terror, heightened by a sense of
      utter loneliness in the presence of the dead, had driven the woman from
      his mind. He had not yet seen the slightest trace of her. Did he have the
      strength to behold a woman mangled as he had found the man... Still, they
      should have decent interment; that was his duty as a man. And further, it
      was necessary that their identity be ascertained, in order that their
      friends might be informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something else. Far back in the mountains, that wilder
      wilderness of the Trinity range, and in the Siskiyou range, beyond them,
      there were huge gray wolves, fierce and formidable. Now and then a daring
      hunter had come out of those mountains with the skin of a great gray wolf.
      There were old stories in the mountains that when the snow had been deep
      and of prolonged duration, the gray wolves came down to the tamer reaches
      inhabited by men, driven thither by hunger, for the game upon which they
      subsisted had fled before the snow to find herbage. The first to come out
      had been deer; soon after them had come the wolves. As the deer fell
      before the rifles of the settlers, the wolves had been driven to
      depredations on cattle and horses. There were ugly tales, too, of men
      attacked by them. Out of all this had grown the legend of a she-wolf that
      bore away children to her wolf-pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the wind now raging in the mountains would come the snow, silent,
      deep, and implacable, to hide the work of the fallen tree below the hut;
      but would it hide everything so well that the great gray wolves, if driven
      by hunger from the remoter mountains, would fail to find what hunger
      required them to seek?
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilder again attacked the tree with his axe,&mdash;another one lay dead
      there, and she must be found; and there was heavy and horrifying work
      ahead before the wind should cease and the snow begin to fall. At first
      the young man resumed his attack with the furious energy that had hitherto
      sustained his effort; but wisdom and caution came now to his aid. He
      realized his feebleness of mind, spirit, and body. He had devoted weeks of
      arduous work to the construction of his hut, and that had lent a certain
      strength to his muscles and buoyancy to his soul. Still, he was hardly
      more than a shadow of his old self, before his life had been wrecked a
      year ago, and he had come into the mountains to make a sturdy fight for
      self-mastery, for the regeneration of whatever shreds of manhood were left
      within him, and for their patching and binding into a fabric that should
      take its place in the ranks of men and work out a man&rsquo;s destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went about his task with greater deliberation. He forced himself to
      regard with calmness the distorted dead face upturned toward him. He
      worked with that slowness which makes greater haste in achievement. This
      brought a surer judgment and an economy of effort and time. He cut the
      branches one by one and dragged them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the woman&rsquo;s form appeared. In the extreme moment of the catastrophe
      she had evidently sprung forward; this had brought her body, face
      downward, between the horses; they, in being crushed under the trunk of
      the tree, fallen across them, had nevertheless given her a certain
      protection; the trunk, in breaking the backs of the horses, had missed her
      head. As for the rest, she was so closely wedged between the horses that
      it would be difficult to extricate her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was finally accomplished after great labor. The woman&rsquo;s
      face and clothing were blood-stained. So much worse did she look than the
      man, that Wilder had a new struggle with himself to command courage and
      strength for the task. He dragged her out to a clear place in the road,
      and made the same perfunctory examination as in the case of the man. While
      he was doing so the woman moved and gasped, and this unexpected indication
      of life was the greatest shock of the tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was one of those shocks which bring new life and strength. Whereas,
      before he had been facing, without daring to contemplate, the awful duty
      that he owed the dead, here now was the most precious thing that the world
      then could have offered him,&mdash;here was Life, human life, fleeting,
      perhaps, but infinitely precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilder knelt beside the unconscious woman and with eager hands loosened
      her clothing. He ran to the river, dipped his handkerchief in the water,
      bathed her face, and removed some of the blood that covered it. He chafed
      her hands and wrists, anxiously watching for the slightest change. This
      came rapidly and progressed steadily. Removed from the crushing pressure
      of the horses, her chest found its natural expansion, and the rhythm of
      deep, slow breathing was established. Wilder had learned numerous
      elementary things from Dr. Malbone; he saw that, although the sufferer was
      so grievously hurt as to be unconscious, life was yet strong within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, then, was the precious element here. The sufferer must be taken at
      once to the hut, and Dr. Malbone summoned. As for the dead man, there was
      no present danger on his account, and the living demanded first attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      A formidable task now confronted the young man. First, he had to bear the
      unconscious woman up the steep trail to the hut; then he should have to go
      many miles afoot to summon Dr. Malbone. The young man thought nothing of
      the difficulties, but all of the doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to assail the task of getting the woman upon his shoulder,
      when it occurred to him that her injuries might possibly be aggravated by
      his manner of carrying her. He thereupon made a hasty examination. The
      head was bleeding. The face bore no visible injuries. The bones of the
      arms were whole. The left leg, however, was broken above the knee. What
      the particular cause of the sufferer&rsquo;s unconsciousness was he could only
      guess. Perhaps it was merely a condition of temporary congestion, produced
      by the fearful pressure to which she had been subjected between the
      horses. A bleeding at the ears and nose seemed to the young man a bad
      sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her condition having been thus approximately ascertained, the next problem
      was to bear her to the hut in a way that should do the least harm to her
      injuries. The first necessary thing to be done, therefore, was to prevent
      any mobility in the region of the fracture. To this end he burrowed again
      into the débris and brought forth some boards that had served as the
      bottom of the wagon. Tearing strips from the woman&rsquo;s clothing, he bound
      the boards to her in a way to protect her from harm in moving her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strain upon his attentiveness sharpened and strengthened him in every
      way. He formed the whole plan of his bearing her to the hut, making her
      temporarily comfortable, summoning Dr. Malbone, and attending to the
      details of nursing her back to health.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lift her gently upon a bowlder; to bend forward and adjust her upon his
      back with infinite care; to proceed with her up the laborious ascent,&mdash;all
      this was skilfully and expeditiously done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serious difficulties began soon to embarrass him. He discovered that she
      was above the average height and weight of women, heavier than he,
      although he was the taller. He found that the numerous abrupt steps in the
      trail laid a heavy tax upon his strength, and that some steep places
      proved slippery under the burden that he bore. In addition, the muscles of
      his arms strained and cramped; and long before he had reached the shelf
      upon which his hut was perched he fell to his knees a number of times from
      exhaustion. But the end came at last when he staggered into his hut,
      dragged a cover from his bed to the floor, and gently laid his burden upon
      it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THREE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>URING all this
      time the fury of the storm had not abated in the least. That, indeed, had
      been one of the worst obstacles with which he had contended in mounting
      the steep to his hut. Immediately upon laying his charge on the floor he
      had begun to prepare his bed for the guest, but weakness from exhaustion
      overcame him. He reeled; a red blindness assailed him; and, in spite of a
      fierce effort to maintain command of his strength and faculties, he found
      himself plunging headlong upon his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moan recalled him to consciousness, and it was not until later that he
      realized the distressing length of time that he had lain unconscious. He
      remembered that when he fell he was very warm from the exertion of
      ascending the slope, and that when he awoke he was excessively cold.
      Furthermore, twilight had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismayed over the loss of time, he proceeded at once to make his charge
      comfortable. He prepared his bed for her and placed her upon it. She was
      still unconscious, but he saw that she was rallying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly realized that it was now impossible for him to summon Dr.
      Mal-bone, for the fury of the storm had been steadily increasing, and the
      crash of falling trees still sounded above the roaring of the wind. It
      would be worse than foolhardy for him to brave the storm and the darkness.
      At any moment she might recover consciousness and find herself alone and
      suffering in this strange place; and a whole night and day would hardly
      have been sufficient for him to fetch the surgeon, had that been a
      physical possibility. So the young man realized that he alone, with no
      training in the surgeon&rsquo;s and physician&rsquo;s art, must take this woman&rsquo;s life
      in his hands, and for a long time to come be her physician and nurse, cook
      and housekeeper, mother and confidant, father and protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      That realization was sufficiently cruel and taxing, but the ordeal that
      now confronted him was the most trying of all. He had not yet given any
      attention to the appearance of his charge, further than to ascertain to
      what extent she was hurt. When he now lighted a candle and held it to her
      face, he saw that she was a young and handsome woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted the high-bred patrician face through the grime, the abundant
      dark-brown hair, the black brows but slightly arched and nearly meeting
      between the eyes, the fine nose, the habitual, half-hidden curve of scorn
      at the corners of her mouth, and the firm, strong, elegantly moulded chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that the man and the woman were father and daughter, for
      the resemblance between the distorted dead face and the grimy living one
      was strong; the manifest difference in ages finished the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she fatally hurt? What if she should die? What effect would the
      knowledge of her father&rsquo;s death have upon her? How long would she remain
      helpless on the couch, held by her injuries; and how long, after her
      possible recovery, would she be held a prisoner by the impassable
      condition of the roads? Would she be cheerful and brave through it all?
    </p>
    <p>
      She was growing more and more restless; wise haste was now the crowning
      necessity. First of all, she must have suitable clothing, and it must be
      provided before he made his bungling efforts to set her broken bone. How
      could he hope to perform this difficult surgical feat with no more
      knowledge of its requirements than he had secured while serving a few
      times as Dr. Malbone&rsquo;s untrained assistant in the mountains, and with the
      most inadequate understanding of the use of such splints, bandages,
      needles, and ligatures as Dr. Malbone had given him for his use upon
      himself in case of an emergency, and with an imperfect knowledge of the
      narcotics, stimulants, febrifuges, and other medicines with which Dr.
      Malbone had provided him? The sufferer had youth and superb health; but
      how could he feel the smallest assurance that, in the event he should
      secure a knitting of the fracture, crookedness and deformity from improper
      adjustment would not result? But there was nothing to do but try, and to
      bring every intelligent force of his nature to the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped that she would not regain consciousness before he should make
      another trip to the scene of the tragedy and secure her luggage. The
      twilight was deepening. He threw logs on the smouldering fire in the
      chimney-place and started to leave. He paused a moment at the door to
      watch his patient. She was again stirring and moaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sedative would be safer,&rdquo; he reflected. And then, when he had poured it
      with great difficulty down her throat, he wondered if he had given her too
      much, and if it would have a bad effect in depressing her vitality and
      working against her rallying. He waited until she had become still and
      quiet, and then hastened down to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm had been gradually changing in character. He had expected the
      snow to wait until the wind had fallen, but a hurricane was still blowing,
      and snow was coming down in long gray slants. Already it had begun to
      whiten and fill crevices into which the wind was driving it. It would have
      been better had he brought a lantern, but there was no time for that; and
      the wind doubtless would have made its use impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the wreck he found his axe and cleared away more branches. Only a very
      faint suggestion of the dead white face peering up at him came through the
      twilight; and there was work to be done in that quarter to-morrow, however
      much snow might be lodged and packed in the branches. Soon he found two
      large and heavy travelling bags, one larger than the other; this, he
      reasoned, must be the woman&rsquo;s; his strength to carry both to the hut was
      inadequate now, and he needed all possible steadiness of nerve for the
      task ahead. A laborious climb brought him back to the hut with the bag and
      his axe. By the light of a candle he anxiously read the name on a silver
      tag attached to the handle of the bag. It was,&mdash;&ldquo;Laura Andros, San
      Francisco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with awe and reverence that he opened the bag and in a gingerly
      fashion drew forth its contents and carefully laid them aside. He had
      already noted in a vague way that his guest was a woman of wealth and
      elegance, and he now observed that, although the articles he disclosed
      were intended in large part for vigorous mountain use, an unmistakable
      stamp of daintiness and refinement was upon them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now found garments in which he could make her comfortable after his
      surgical work was done, he proceeded with the stupendous task that awaited
      him. He wondered how much precious time he had lost, if any, through sheer
      dread of his duty. But whatever the delay, and whatever its causes, it had
      been useful in preparing him for the ordeal. Up to this moment an
      unaccountable and distressing trembling of all his members at frequent
      intervals had alarmed him, but strength and steadiness came with his
      nearer approach to the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commanding his soul to meet the need of the hour, he went sturdily about
      his work. He knew how desperately painful were operations for the setting
      of fractured bones, and how great was the skill required for the
      administering of an anæsthetic. He had never known even a skilled surgeon
      to undertake alone what he must now do without either skill or assistance.
      It would not be sufficient should he do his best: his best must be
      perfectly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced his store of splints, bandages, stimulants, and anaesthetics,
      and arranged them conveniently to hand, as he had seen Dr. Malbone do. He
      examined his patient&rsquo;s pulse; it was too quick and weak to give him high
      confidence. He made a good fire, for the night was cold; and he called
      heavily upon his store of candles to furnish as much light as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bed, upon which she lay, was a most crude and inadequate affair. It
      was of his own construction, and had been intended to serve its part in
      the life of severe austerity that he had made for himself in the
      mountains. It was made of rough boards nailed to wooden posts. To serve
      for mattress, fragrant pine-needles filled it. Upon this were spread
      sheets and blankets. The pillow also was made of pine-needles. Thus,
      without springs, the bed was hard and unfit for a daintily reared woman;
      more so because of the illness that she would suffer and the great length
      of time that she would be confined to the bed; but it was the best he had.
      As the hut was very small and had but one room, this bed had been fitted
      snugly into a corner. Wilder moved it out, that he might be able to work
      freely on both sides of it. This cramped the hut all the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The examination that he had made in the road was for the purpose of
      discovering broken bones. There he had found the bone of the left thigh
      broken at some undetermined point between the knee and the hip. But broken
      bones are not all the hurts that one may receive in such an accident,&mdash;cuts
      and contusions might prove equally dangerous if overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      With exquisite care he prepared her for the work that he must do. As she
      was fully dressed, this required patience from his unskilled hands.
      Finally, this part of the task, inexpressibly hard for a man of his
      delicacy of feeling, was accomplished. What anguish he suffered on his own
      account and in foreseeing her confusion and possible resentment upon
      realizing that he, an utter stranger, and not a physician, had done all
      this for her, it were idle to set forth here.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great relief he found that the bone of the left thigh was, so far
      as he could judge, the only one that had suffered fracture; but a careful
      inspection revealed several bruises; and at last, in searching for the
      source of the blood that had covered her face when he drew her from the
      débris, he found a cut in her crown. His first work must be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covering her comfortably, he washed the blood from her hair and face, and,
      bearing in mind the pride that she must have cherished for her glorious
      hair, he quickly shaved as small a space on her crown as possible. He
      first tried adhesive plaster to bring the edges of the cut together; but
      the water and his handling of the wound started the hemorrhage afresh, and
      this compelled him to close the wound with ligatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pleased to observe that the hemorrhage was stopped. This made him
      so well satisfied and so confident that the greater magnitude of the
      remaining work appalled him less. Indeed, that had begun to exercise a
      scientific fascination that abnormally sharpened his wits and steadied his
      nerves. It was this task that he now attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the sufferer had lain unconscious. This was a blessing,
      unless the state had been induced by causes worse than consciousness of
      the pain from setting the bone. There was time hereafter to consider all
      that. The one present duty was to proceed with the operation without
      another moment&rsquo;s delay, for inflammation had already set in.
    </p>
    <p>
      While, with infinite care, he was fitting, as best he could, the ends of
      the broken bone, he was startled out of all self-command by a scream of
      agony from her, half-strangled, and therefore made all the more
      terrifying, by the bandage under her chin; and she was sitting up, staring
      at him. Every one of the young man&rsquo;s faculties was temporarily paralyzed.
      A benumbing coldness was upon him. With a mighty effort he gathered
      himself up, but his breathing was difficult, and sweat streamed down his
      face. He firmly laid her back upon the pillow, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet; you shall not be hurt again.&rdquo; She was singularly docile,
      although he could see by the wildness of her eyes and a fluttering in her
      throat that something was raging within her. With one hand he gently
      pressed her eyelids down, and with the other he wetted a handkerchief from
      a bottle of chloroform and held it just clear of her mouth and nostrils.
      For a moment she rebelled against the stifling vapor and tried to drag his
      hand away; but, finding him determined, she yielded, and soon was
      stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work must be rapid now. There was no time to wonder if she had
      comprehended anything or seen in him a stranger. No interruption could
      come from her now; that was the vital thing; but the anaesthetic would
      soon lose its force. He resumed his work, taking great care, in matching
      the injured member with the sound one, to avoid crippling her for life. He
      then adjusted the splints, keeping the member straight. Finally, he
      secured it against bending at the knee by adjusting a board on the under
      side of the leg throughout its entire length. He finished his work by
      binding the upper part of her body to the bed-frame, to prevent her
      rising. Then, extinguishing his candles, making her as comfortable as
      possible on the hard bed, and putting more wood on the fire, he sat down
      to watch. Everything seemed to be going well.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the night was far advanced. The wind was still blowing a
      terrific gale. An aching, irresistible weariness stole over the watcher.
      He drew his chair close to the bed and anxiously observed his charge. He
      examined her pulse; it was rising; her skin was hot and dry. She had
      passed from under the influence of the anaesthetic, and was now sleeping
      restlessly. He waited in dread for her awaking, for the unexpected
      situation in which the young man found himself was complex and difficult.
      It was essential that his patient should be as tranquil as possible.
      Knowledge of her father&rsquo;s death might prove disastrous. Hence she must be
      deceived, and yet deception was unspeakably repugnant to the young man&rsquo;s
      nature. But now it was a duty, which above all things must be done. She
      must be buoyed with hope. All her fortitude would be needed to bear the
      miserable conditions of her imprisonment. Meantime, the young man would
      post notices along the road, calling for help from the first persons
      passing.

      CHAPTER FOUR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>UCH thinking and
      planning had to be done, for the unexpected situation in which the young
      man found himself was complex and difficult. It was essential that his
      patient should be as tranquil as possible. Knowledge of her father&rsquo;s death
      might prove disastrous. Hence she must be deceived, and yet deception was
      unspeakably repugnant to the young man&rsquo;s nature. But now it was a duty,
      which above all things must be done. She must be buoyed with hope. All her
      fortitude would be needed to bear the miserable conditions of her
      imprisonment. Meantime, the young man would post notices along the road,
      calling for help from the first persons passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the road was wholly impassable, and it would grow worse. None of
      the friends or relatives of the dead man and his daughter could have been
      informed of their leaving the lakes. The natural conclusion from their
      absence would be that an early winter of unusual severity had compelled
      them to remain until spring. The people in the mountains would have no way
      of learning that the two had failed to reach the railway. Thus had the
      travellers been completely blotted out of their world. No relief parties
      would be sent out to search for them. Not until the unlikely discovery of
      the notices that Wilder would post could there be the slightest knowledge
      of the tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than that, the road upon which Wilder&rsquo;s hut looked down was only one
      of two that penetrated the wilderness in that direction. In the summer it
      had a small travel, but by reason of its crookedness, narrowness, and
      sharp grades it was avoided by heavy traffic. It would be the last road to
      be cleared. Snow-shoes were practically unknown in these mountains, for
      seasons of long snow blockades were rare; but there would be no occasion
      for snow-shoe travel over this road. The only prospect for the escape of
      Wilder and his charge was on foot, after the lapse of the months that
      would be required for her recovery, and after the snow was gone.

    <p>
      Innumerable domestic perplexities presented themselves to the young man&rsquo;s
      mind. His charge, being perfectly helpless, must depend entirely upon him
      for her every want. Would she have the wisdom and goodness to accept the
      situation cheerfully, or would its humiliation and hardships gnaw
      constantly at her strength and patience, and delay her recovery or
      precipitate her death? How could she possibly accept the situation
      philosophically? She would find a bitter contrast between this life and
      the one of luxury and indulgence to which she had been accustomed. Even
      should she develop the highest order of fortitude, the rude food, in small
      variety, that he had to give her, cooked badly, could hardly tempt her
      appetite, and thus build up her strength. Then, her bed was a wretched
      affair, and there was serious danger that its hardness alone, without
      regard to her possible resignation to its discomforts, would produce
      hurtful physical results. If only wise and helpful Dr. Malbone could know
      and come!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the days bring forth what they would, Wilder would do his duty as he
      knew it. The fire crackled cheerily on the hearth and filled the hut with
      its warmth and glow and peace. The walls were tight and strong, and were
      holding firm against the storm. The agonizing strain of the last twelve
      hours was over, and all strength must be saved for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the flickering firelight the young man studied the face of his charge
      at leisure, and he saw that she was singularly handsome; but there seemed
      to be a certain hardness in her face, relaxed in unconsciousness though it
      was. Perhaps it was only because there stood out before his memory the one
      face in all the world that, with its infinite gentleness and sweetness,
      embodied every grace for which his spirit yearned. It was not so beautiful
      and brilliant a face as this,&mdash;but there came up Dr. Malbone&rsquo;s
      warning, uttered over and over with the most earnest impressiveness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you value your reason and life, as you value the possibilities of your
      happiness and your usefulness to humanity, turn your face from the past,
      and with all the courage and will of a man confront the future. Nature is
      kind to all of her children who love her and seek her. She heaps our past
      with wreckage, only to train and prepare us for a noble future. There can
      be no peace where there has been no travail. There would be no strength
      were there no weakness in need of its help. The man who fails to the
      slightest extent in his duties to humanity and himself burdens his life to
      that extent. Be brave and hopeful and helpful, as it becomes a man to be,
      and labor incessantly for the best, as it becomes a man to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the man with the curiously-twisted face peering out from the
      tree-branches, what had been the aim of his life, that it should find such
      an end? After all, was there any taint of unmanliness in that end?
      Doubtless even now he was covered deep under snow. If he should be left
      there, the great gray wolves might come down and find him. They were big
      and powerful, and men who had seen them hungry told fearful tales of their
      daring and ferocity. If the snow should drive them down, they would find
      the dead horses under the tree; and after that there would be but one
      house here where they could find human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      There need be no dread of them; but suppose that some night there should
      come a scratching at the door of the hut,&mdash;that would mean the gaunt
      shewolf, who bore away children to the wolf-pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would beg for a rind of bacon to eat, and a corner on the hearth to
      sleep. She would bear ugly wounds from her struggles with men and beasts,
      and these would have to be dressed, and rents in her hide stitched; and if
      there were broken bones, they must be set. Would she be patient under the
      torture, or would she snap and howl after the manner of wolves?...
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilder was startled to full consciousness by a moan. He bent over his
      patient and looked into her open eyes. She gazed up at him vacantly. He
      took her hand; it was hot. He placed a hand upon her forehead; it was
      burning. A haggard look of pain and distress sat upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      An eager appeal was in her glance, and her lips moved feebly. He bent his
      ear to them. She was faintly whispering&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water, water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His heart bounding with gladness, he brought cold water. With difficulty
      he restrained her eagerness, lest she discover that she was crippled and
      bound. He covered her eyes with a napkin, for he observed that her glance
      was becoming strained and curious. She submitted quietly, while he gave
      her the water with a spoon. After that she sighed in weariness and
      content, but her deep inspiration was checked by pain. Her burning skin
      and an uneasiness throughout her entire frame warned him that she had a
      fever. He gave her a remedy for that. It was not until daylight had come
      that, after watching her for hours as she lay awake and seemingly
      halfconscious, he observed her finally drift into sound slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man rose and found himself weak and dizzy; but after he had
      prepared and eaten a simple breakfast he felt stronger. Seemingly by a
      miracle, he had gone through his task in safety thus far. He must now
      leave his patient for a while, to discharge a grim duty that awaited him
      in the road below,&mdash;a duty from which his every sensibility recoiled
      with unspeakable repugnance. Lest an untoward accident should happen in
      his absence, he gave his patient a stupefying drug.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreaded to open the front door of his hut. When he did, he found the
      thing that he feared: the wind had ceased after midnight, and the snow had
      been falling ever since, and still was falling. It had whitened the walls
      of the canon, and, before the wind had ceased, had eddied and drifted
      about the hut in a way that filled the young man with alarm for the
      future. Would his strength be sufficient to fight it if the storm should
      be greatly prolonged, to the end that he and his charge should not be
      buried alive?
    </p>
    <p>
      He put this dread away, and with a heavy heart followed the steep trail
      down to the road.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OON was near at
      hand when the guest of the hut waked to full consciousness. Her first
      impulse was to cry out with the pain that tortured her; but her strong
      will assumed command, and she looked inquiringly into the anxious face
      beside her Obviously she realized that a catastrophe had overtaken her,
      and she was now silently demanding an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilder had not expected this. Her calmness, and, more than that, her
      silent demand, were so different from the childish and unreasonable
      petulance that he had expected, that he was unprepared and confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been hurt,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;and it will be necessary for you to
      keep very quiet for a time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was I hurt?&rdquo; she faintly asked. &ldquo;The horses were frightened by the
      storm and ran away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the storm! I remember.&rdquo; Then she looked quickly and anxiously about.
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she said,&mdash;&ldquo;where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the oddly distorted face in the branches came grimacing
      between Wilder and his duty, but with a gasp and a repelling gesture he
      drove it away,&mdash;not so dexterously but that his struggle was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;has gone to bring help,&rdquo; he said. Then, quickly leaving the
      bedside to conceal his weakness and the shame of the lie that choked him,
      he added hastily, &ldquo;Yes, he was not hurt; and when he and I had brought you
      to this hut he went to find help. He will return as soon as possible.&rdquo; He
      felt that her glance was upon him with merciless steadiness. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said
      he, returning to the couch, &ldquo;I will remove these bandages,&rdquo;&mdash;referring
      to the cords that bound her to the bed;&mdash;&ldquo;but you must promise me not
      to move except under my direction. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slightly nodded an assent, and he unbound her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you must have some of this broth. No, don&rsquo;t try to
      rise; I will feed you from this spoon. It is not too hot, is it? That is
      good. Presently you will feel much better. You are not in much pain now,
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a child,&rdquo; she answered, with a slight touch of disdain and
      reproof. But he cheerily said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, excellent! That is the way to feel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lay silent for a while, looking up at the roof. Presently she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine that I am badly hurt. Please tell me how and where I am
      injured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your left leg was hurt, and we shall have to keep it bandaged and
      your knee from bending. And there were some bruises on your side, and an
      injury to the scalp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My scalp?&rdquo; she quickly asked, raising her hand and asking, &ldquo;Surely you
      did not shave my head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, smiling amusedly; &ldquo;except a small spot, and you can
      cover that until the hair grows out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not fully satisfied until she had felt the splendid wealth of hair
      that lay massed upon the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask who you are?&rdquo; This was the question that he had dreaded most of
      all; but before he could stammer out the truth a light broke over her
      face, and she astounded him with this exclamation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are the famous Dr. Mal-bone! This is extraordinary! I am very,
      very fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilder had never conceived a lie so dazzling and happy as this mistake.
      Between wonder at his stupidity for not having thought of it, and a great
      delight that she had so naturally erred, he was too bewildered either to
      affirm or deny. He only realized that she had unwittingly solved the most
      difficult of his present problems. Had she been looking at him, she might
      have wondered at the strange expression that lighted up his face, and
      particularly the crimson temporarily displacing the death-like pallor that
      she had observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she resumed, after a pause, &ldquo;I am fortunate; for I suppose that my
      injuries are a great deal worse than you have given me to believe, and
      that such skill as yours is needed.&rdquo; She turned her glance again full upon
      him; but he had recovered his address, and now met her look with an
      approach to steadiness. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are a much younger man than
      I had expected to see; and you don&rsquo;t look so crabbed as I might have
      inferred you were from the message you sent me a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, evidently expecting him to make some explanation; but he was
      silent, and looked so distressed that she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may remember,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that a young lady at the lakes sent
      for you to treat her for bruises sustained in a fall, and that you told
      her messenger to give her your compliments and say that cold-water
      applications, an old woman, and God would do as well with such a case as
      you. I am that young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilder liked the young woman&rsquo;s blunt and forthright manner, although it
      was novel and embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were doubtless important cases demanding attention,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; she agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, after all,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you follow the advice and get good
      results?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, again smiling faintly; &ldquo;that is true.&rdquo; She closed her
      eyes. Presently she extended her hand, which Wilder took. She looked
      earnestly into his face, and asked, &ldquo;It will be a long siege with me, will
      it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much depends upon your temperament,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is evasion,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Be candid with me.&rdquo; There was no
      demand in this request; it was an appeal from such depths of her as she
      knew, and it touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bone is broken, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you are young and your health is superb. That is everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A despairing look grayed her face, which then quickly reddened with anger
      and rebellion. Her host said nothing. He saw that she was competent to
      make the fight with herself without his aid; that her mind, though now
      disturbed by her suffering, was able to comprehend much that her condition
      meant, being obviously an uncommonly strong, clear mind, and that it would
      give to an acceptance of her position the philosophic view that was so
      much needed. He saw the hard, brave fight that she was making, and he had
      no fear for the outcome. Gradually he saw the contemplative expression of
      the eyes turned within, and the face grow gaunt and haggard under the
      strain. As slowly he saw her emerge from the depths into which he had
      thrust her, and from the very slowness of the victory, he knew that she
      had won. When again she looked into his face, he knew that her soul had
      been tried as it never had been before, and that she was stronger and
      better for it. And he knew that there was yet another trial awaiting her
      which perhaps she could not have borne had not she passed through this
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; she said, as earnestly as before; &ldquo;when do you expect my
      father to return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon&mdash;as soon as he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evasion again,&rdquo; she protested, a slight frown of impatience darkening her
      face; but it instantly disappeared, and her manner was appealing again.
      &ldquo;Be my friend as well as my physician, Dr. Malbone. Please tell me the
      truth. I can bear it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed his head in dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow is still falling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and doubtless many trees are across the
      road. We can only wait and hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A transient look of gratitude for his seeming candor softened her hard
      beauty, and she withdrew her hand and her glance. Then he knew that
      another mighty struggle was taking place within her. He knew from the deep
      crimson that suffused her face how fully she realized all that he must be
      to her during the weary weeks to come. He saw the outward evidences of the
      unthinkable revulsion that filled her, with him as its cause. He knew that
      in agony of soul she rebelled against the fate that had placed her
      helpless in the hands of a stranger, and that stranger a man, and that man
      the one now serving her, however willingly, however faithfully, with
      whatever tact and delicacy. He saw, from her hopless glance about the
      cabin, the bitterness of the fight that she was making to accept its
      repellent hospitality. And, worst of all, he saw, or thought he saw, that
      in the victory that she finally won there was more of an iron
      determination to endure than of a simple resignation to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      So these two began their strange life together. As may be supposed, it was
      wholly devoid of true companionship, and necessarily so. That made it the
      harder, in a way, for both. From the severe furnishings of his larder the
      host did his best to provide for her comfort. She never complained of the
      coarse, inadequate food, all of which had to be of a kind that could bear
      keeping for months, and none of which was pleasing to a fastidious taste
      made all the more delicate by illness and prostration from her injuries.
      All of the countless attentions that her helplessness imposed upon him he
      gave with the business-like directness of a physician and nurse, and this
      was obviously gratifying to her. She never complained of the cruel
      hardness of the bed, and never failed to express her gratitude for the
      slight shiftings of position that he deemed it safe to give her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most cheering to the host was the fair progress that his patient made. Her
      curious mistake that he was Dr. Malbone had given him a mastery of the
      situation that was of inestimable value. Manifestly she reposed full
      confidence in his skill, and he made the most of that. She never again
      asked for opinions concerning her father&rsquo;s return. Her only inquiries were
      with regard to the weather, the severity of which did not relax from day
      to day, from week to week. When Wilder would return from short excursions
      over the snow, which now lay deep throughout the mountains and was
      steadily growing deeper, she would look at him a moment expectantly,
      hoping for good news; but it was not necessary for him to say that there
      was none, and she asked no questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dread and dismay of Wilder grew with the heaping up of snow about the
      hut. Before he built the house, he had learned that in winter, when the
      storms were very severe, the shelf upon which he had reared the structure
      was banked with snow, but to what height no one had ever ascertained.
      There had never been such a storm as this within the memory of the white
      settlers. Hence the snow was heaped higher than ever before. There were
      special reasons for this. The shelf formed an eddying-point for the wind
      that came in the intervals of the snowfall, and the snow from all sides
      was thus swirled and pitched upon the shelf. It had not yet reached the
      roof, but it had to be kept cleared from the window and the front door,
      and that meant watchfulness and labor. Should it continue to accumulate
      until it reached the roof and the top of the chimney, a serious situation
      would confront the prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not while the patient remained helpless was there anything but a rigid
      business bearing between these two unhappy mortals. Between them was
      reared an impalpable wall that neither cared to attack. But in time the
      patient grew better and stronger both in body and mind; and, besides,
      strange developments began to make themselves felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the effects of the young woman, Wilder had discovered a book in
      which she kept a journal. She had called for it as soon as she was able to
      write; and, as a woman&rsquo;s observation is keener than a man&rsquo;s, it is best to
      introduce here (and in other places throughout the narrative) such
      extracts from her journal as seem helpful.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER SIX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following is
      from the lady&rsquo;s journal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will write it again, absurd though it may turn out to be: There is
      some mystery about this cabin. I have tried over and over to convince
      myself that my weakness and the unnatural situation in which I am placed
      make me morbid and suspicious; but I know that I am still a hard-headed
      woman, without a particle of nonsense in my composition; and I know that I
      am able to see things in their proper light, and to understand them in a
      way. And I say that the signs of something wrong here are growing more and
      more evident, without furnishing me the least clue to the nature of the
      mystery; but I feel that, whatever the mystery is, it is one to be
      dreaded. I try not to think about it; but where is the sense in that? Is
      it not better for me to do all the observing and thinking I can, and thus
      be the better prepared for whatever may happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes try to think that it is only the strangeness of this strange
      man&mdash;if I may call him a man&mdash;that makes me feel a mystery in
      the air. It is hard to get hold of anything tangible in his bearing, so
      unobtrusively alert he is. There must be some explanation of the fact that
      a physician as skilful as he is should bury himself in these mountains&mdash;should
      hide himself from the different world to which he evidently belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a gentleman,&mdash;I will do him the justice to admit that. He is a
      great deal besides any gentleman that I have ever seen before. Let me try
      to explain this to myself. Although he makes not the slightest show of
      attending to my wants, I know his every thought is upon me. He sleeps on
      the stone floor in front of the fireplace,&mdash;that is, if he sleeps at
      all, which I sometimes doubt. Even when he is not looking at me in that
      distant, abstracted way that he has, I feel that the whole cabin is filled
      with his eyes, and that they are always looking at me, day and night, but
      with an expression different from the veiled one of his own eyes. They do
      not have the distant, thoughtful, perfunctory, business-like expression of
      the eyes in his head, but a different one,&mdash;an expression that seems
      to be a mixture of duty, pity, kindness, patience, forbearance, and&mdash;it
      will make me feel better to write it&mdash;<i>contempt</i>. I feel that
      these countless eyes are reading my deepest thoughts, and looking over my
      shoulder as I write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do not really feel all this, else I should not be writing
      thus. But I feel something. O God! when will this wretched strain be
      over?...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have discovered that he guards most jealously the back door of the
      cabin. When I first came to consciousness after my hurt, I saw what I took
      to be evidence that my strength of will was greater than his. I believe so
      yet; but he certainly has a way of baffling me and holding me in a
      position from which I cannot escape. I am curious to know a great many
      things; it is my right to know them. Why does he surround himself with a
      deafness that nothing can penetrate? Why and how does he make it
      impossible for me to ask him questions? And who ever heard of a man so
      supremely indifferent as not to ask a woman placed as I am a single
      question about herself, her life, her tastes, her family, her world? Why
      has he made it impossible for me to ask him any questions? At first he had
      placed my bed so that I could see the rear door by turning my head; but
      when he observed that I had become curious, he found an excuse to turn my
      bed so that it was impossible for me to see the door, and I was too proud
      to object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could have respect for him. Of course he surmises that I am
      wealthy, and he must know that he will be handsomely paid for his
      services. I gave him to understand as much one day, and he looked at me in
      a blank way that was most disconcerting. But that did not deceive me. I do
      not wish to be unjust, but I know something about human nature. I think
      that the man&rsquo;s whole course may be to impress me with his great solicitude
      and make his services appear the more valuable. Bah! he needn&rsquo;t have gone
      to the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to watch that door in spite of him. I know already that he
      keeps it carefully locked, and that when he goes out he bars it on the
      other side. Such distrust, when I am so unable to pry into his secrets, is
      unwarranted and offensive. Another thing I have noted. The back door leads
      into some kind of inner apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he going to guard it when I am able to be about? Then his life
      will be a burden. I will make it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude? Oh, yes! I have heard of such a thing. But this is an
      obligation that money can discharge, and I will see that it does. Has he
      done anything more for me than a physician ought to do? I am familiar with
      the ways in which these gentry play upon the gratitude of their wealthy
      patients, and present bills that they think a sense of shame will accept.
      So long as the rich are the prey of the poor, the poor need not expect
      sympathy from the rich. I know the power of money to secure attendance of
      all sorts, and I can see its power manifested now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man seems to be utterly lacking in masculine qualities. To give an
      illustration: The other day, when he thought I was absorbed in reading,&mdash;I
      must say that he has excellent taste in books,&mdash;I found tears
      trickling down his cheeks while he was reading before the fire. I noted
      from the division of the book as he held it open the approximate place
      where he was reading. Afterward I asked him for the book, and found that
      it opened readily at a place where the leaves were tear-stained. It was
      the silliest story imaginable,&mdash;a foolish account of true-lovers
      separated by designing persons and dying of a broken heart! Imagine a
      grown man crying over such nonsense as that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a queer circumstance that I have noted, and have wondered about:
      In not a single one of Dr. Malbone&rsquo;s books does his name appear; and it is
      evident that wherever it did appear he has erased it. There may be easy
      ways of accounting for this, but to me it looks suspicious. Is it a part
      of the mystery of a refined and skilful physician burying&mdash;I believe
      hiding&mdash;himself in these mountains? I remember to have heard at the
      lakes that he never attended city people spending the summer here if he
      could avoid it. I certainly know that he refused to visit me, and that he
      sent me an insulting message besides. What is the reason? Is he more or
      less acquainted with people of the better class, and is he afraid of
      meeting some whom he may have known when he lived somewhere else and
      passed under a different name? The inhabitants of these mountains venerate
      him, and believe that his skill is omnipotent. Well, I have nothing to say
      against his skill, for certainly he has handled my case perfectly; but if
      these simple and ignorant mountain-folk should see him in the intimacy in
      which I know him, and discover what a cold, suspicious, weak, petty man he
      is, I think they would reform their opinion of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the last month he has been going oftener and oftener through the
      back door. What business has he there? If I did not have a feeling that,
      little as he trusts me, I might safely trust him to the end of the world,
      I would have a fear for my own safety. But I rest secure in the belief
      that the prospect of collecting a generous fee for restoring me safe to my
      father is a sufficient protection, to say nothing of the confidence that I
      have in the man&rsquo;s queer sense of honor. Why, he treats me as though I were
      a queen, and bears himself as my humblest subject hanging upon my smallest
      word&mdash;up to a certain point. Beyond that I get bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my father, my father! There is no man in the world like you, none
      that knows me, that loves me as you do! If you only knew how my heart
      yearns every moment for you! Why could not this man have the least of your
      qualities,&mdash;your iron will, your scorn of weak things in human
      nature, your dominating, achieving power It is in comparing this man with
      you that I find him so small, so pusillanimous, so different from the
      standard of manhood that you have made me adopt, so different from me, so
      infinitely far from me. It is good that it is so, but it makes me lonely
      beyond all expression. I would rather be alone in a desert than with this
      strange mirage of a man, this male with an infinite capacity for the
      little things that only little women are suited to do. He tortures me with
      his goodness, his self-sacrifice to me, his making me feel that he lives
      only to make me comfortable and bring me back to health. Where are you, my
      father? I know that you will come to me when you can. That much I know, I
      know! Come, father, and take me from this awful prison!...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have done remarkably well to be as patient as I have been. This
      horrid food is enough to kill a healthy woman,&mdash;tinned meats and
      vegetables, tinned everything, and hardly any flour, but sea-biscuits
      instead! Of course my poor slave does his best to prepare things in such a
      way that it will be possible for me to eat them, for he seems to realize
      that I am a human being....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am determined to bring this man to an acquaintance with his tongue. The
      loneliness that I feel is unbearable. He must be as lonely as I, and, like
      me, he is probably too proud to make a sign. Of course he talks to me now
      when I make him, but about things in Asia or Africa that I am certain are
      as dull to him as to me. He is maintaining this distance, I am certain,
      just to guard his history and true character, and to keep me in a position
      where it will remain impossible for me to find out what is going forward
      on the other side of that door. I will talk to him about myself; that will
      compel him to talk about himself. I can&rsquo;t bear this isolation. It is
      inhuman. And I have no fears that he will presume. They passed long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just two more things to record at present. One is that my host is
      growing thinner and more hollow-eyed, and the other is that several times
      lately I have dreamed of hearing the strangest and sweetest music. It
      sounded like the playing of a violin by a master hand. I have been unable
      to determine whether I was really dreaming. One singular thing in
      connection with it is that when I looked for him the other night on his
      rugs before the fire after I had heard the music, or dreamed I heard it,
      he was not there. I tried to remain awake until he returned, for I
      wondered where he could be in the middle of the night, with the snow
      heaped up to the roof of the house and a fearful gale blowing cold
      outside, and I felt lonely and uneasy. But I went to sleep before he
      returned. I have no doubt, however, that he was on the other side of the
      rear door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This ends, for the present, the extracts from the lady&rsquo;s journal.

      CHAPTER SEVEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE patient had so
      far recovered that she could be propped up in bed, where she straightened
      out the bungling work of her inexperienced hair-dresser, and made her
      glorious hair a fit embellishment of her beauty. She was pale, and her
      cheeks had lost the roundness and her eyes the brilliancy of their wont.
      But she was regaining the flesh that she had lost, and the brightness of
      spirit that her afflictions had dimmed; and her pallor only softened and
      refined a beauty that likely had been somewhat too showy in health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something even better than that had been accomplished. It was not
      conceivable that her strong and rebellious spirit had been ever before
      brought under other than the ordinary restraints of a conventional life.
      She had developed the good sense to make the most of her present
      uncomfortable situation, and the will to bear its hardships. In the eyes
      of her host the superiority of her character entitled her to admiration,
      which he gave her simply and unconsciously, without any regard to her sex
      and beauty. Her acute insight had informed her of this admiration, and her
      spirit chafed under its character. One day she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems strange to me, Dr. Malbone, that you have never taken any
      interest in my past life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her quickly and curiously, and somewhat awkwardly replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not wish to intrude, Miss Andros.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that have been intrusion? I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know that I feel an interest in everything that concerns you.&rdquo;
       He said this readily, simply, and naturally, and she wondered if he was
      sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;lack of all companionship between us means
      mutual distrust.&rdquo; This was a sharp thrust, and it found him unguarded.
      Then she saw that she had gone too far at the start; and this impression
      was confirmed when, after a pause, he remarked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I have been strangely placed. I knew that the conventions of the
      best-bred people mean much to you, and I have merely respected your
      natural and proper regard for them. Under these circumstances it was not
      possible for me to make the first effort to be&mdash;friendly, if you will
      permit the expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, but the manliness of the rebuke and its entire justice made
      her secretly resent it. She was determined to hold herself perfectly in
      hand, for a serious purpose now moved her, and she would not be balked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all in the past now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have learned to know you as a
      man of the finest sense of honor, proud, reserved, and self-sacrificing.
      It would not have been possible for any other sort of man to treat a woman
      as you have treated me. No, don&rsquo;t interrupt me. There is nothing but
      common sense and simple justice in what I am saying, and unless you let me
      say it you will be harsh and cruel. After all that you have done for me,
      it is my right to tell you how I feel about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked so embarrassed and miserable that she laughed outright; and the
      music of that rare note sounded in his heart; for it was not a cruel
      laugh, but merry and hearty, as one would laugh at the comical
      discomfiture of a friend; and as such it fulfilled its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the ice that had filled the cabin was broken, in a measure, at last,
      and this at once eased the gloom and coldness of the wretched lives
      imprisoned therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that beginning the convalescent drifted easily and gracefully into an
      account of her world of wealth and pleasure and fashion. She realized that
      she must first open her own life before she could expect her host to give
      her a view of his and of the nearer and stranger things that impinged upon
      her. Her voice was smooth and musical. She dwelt particularly upon the
      lighter and fashionable side of her life, because she believed that the
      tact and refinement of the man who listened so well, yet so silently, were
      born of such a life, and that he had deliberately withdrawn himself from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters went more smoothly after that day. But the young woman was finally
      forced to accept her defeat,&mdash;she had opened her own simple, vacant
      life, but had gained not a glimpse into his. And she realized, further,
      that all the advances toward a friendlier understanding had been made by
      her, and none by him; that his manner toward her, with all its tireless
      watchfulness, its endless solicitude, its total extinction of every
      selfish thought, its impenetrable reserve, had not changed one jot or
      tittle. Then a bitter resentment filled her, and she hated him and
      determined to torture him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been so guarded but that she had found a vulnerable spot in his
      mail. This was what she regarded as the silly, sentimental side of his
      nature. She had led him into this disclosure by a long series of adroit
      moves, the purpose of which he had not suspected. Assuming a profound
      appreciation of the softer and tenderer things of life, she had brought
      herself into the attitude of one who cherishes them, and thus led him into
      the trap. Their talk concerned love, and he opened his heart and displayed
      all its foolish weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can there be anything more sacred,&rdquo; he asked, warmly, &ldquo;than the love of
      men and women? Is there anything to which trifling should be more
      repugnant? The man who loves one woman with all in him that makes him a
      man, has taken that into his soul which will be its refining and uplifting
      force to the end of all things with him; and, noble as that is, the love
      of a woman for one man who loves her surpasses it beyond all
      comprehension, and is the truest gleam of heavenly radiance in human
      lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was spared him to see the amused and contemptuous curl of lip that
      bespoke a world-worn heart; but he had let down his guard, and his
      punishment would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some days afterward that the blow fell. The convalescent was now
      sitting on a chair, where her ever-solicitous nurse had placed her. She
      was now ready to strike. She would hold up to him a mirror of himself,&mdash;a
      weak, sentimental, pusillanimous man. Fortunately, she could relate from
      an experience in her own life a tale whose ridiculous hero she judged had
      been just such a man as Dr. Malbone. She would be violating none of the
      rules of hospitality. Her host had permitted her to walk into a
      humiliating position, and her desire to punish him should not be denied
      gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought the talk round to the mistakes that men and women make in
      the bestowal of their affection, and remarked carelessly that men were
      proverbially stupid in estimating the loveliness of women. Almost without
      exception, she declared, they preferred girls for their beauty, their
      softness, their negative qualities, their genuine or pretended
      helplessness; and she added that a woman of strength and true worth would
      scorn a love so cheaply won and held in so light esteem by its bestowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But some girls,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;are even worse than men. You may generally
      expect stupidity from a man, but not always folly from a girl. A rather
      distressing case of a girl&rsquo;s folly once came to my notice. There was a
      girl who had been my classmate in school. It was there that we formed for
      each other the girlish affection which all girls must have at that age.
      Yet the difference between us was great even then, and it increased after
      we had gone out into the world. She and I moved in the same circle. Her
      parents were wealthy, and she had every opportunity to see and learn life
      and get something of value from it. Instead of that, she grew more and
      more retired, and less fitted for the life to which she belonged. She was
      the most unpractical and romantic girl that ever lived. Her girl friends
      dropped her one by one. I was the last to remain, and I did all I could to
      get some worldly sense into her soft and foolish head. She would only
      smile, and put her arms round me, and declare that she knew she was
      foolish, but that she couldn&rsquo;t help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very fond of music and poetry, and at last I learned that she was
      taking lessons on the violin from some fiddling nobody who made his living
      by playing and teaching. I never happened to see him, or I might have done
      something to stop the mischief that was brewing. Her parents were blind to
      her folly, but that is a common weakness of parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never had been any great exchange of confidences between Ada and me
      since our school-days. I could have told her a great deal about the ways
      of men,&mdash;you see,&rdquo; the narrator hastened to add, &ldquo;I had been a very
      good observer, and had learned some things that it is to the advantage of
      every girl to know. I mean, you understand, about love. It is only people
      with a silly view of that subject that ever get into trouble. Girls of
      Ada&rsquo;s disposition have no sense; they invariably suffer through lack of
      perception and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although I did not see much of her, it at last became evident that
      something serious was the matter. Her manner became softer and gentler,
      her sympathies were keener, and there was a light in her eyes that an
      observing woman cannot misunderstand. I was somewhat older than she, and
      that gave me an advantage in the plan that I decided upon; but of greater
      advantage was her reliance upon me. It was necessary that I should gain
      her full confidence, as I didn&rsquo;t wish to take any step in the dark, nor
      one that might have proved useless. You will understand that in all I
      afterward did and caused to be done I acted solely from a regard for her
      welfare. I believed that she had formed an attachment for this&mdash;this
      fiddler&mdash;bah! Everything in me revolts when I think of it. Here was a
      girl that was pretty, sweet, gracious, the soul of trust and fidelity,
      ready to throw herself away upon an unspeakable fiddler! And there was no
      excuse whatever for it. A score of men adored her,&mdash;men of her own
      station in life,&mdash;men of wealth, men of culture, men of strength and
      character, men of birth, men of consequence in the world. Incredible as it
      may seem, they passed over other girls far more capable in every way, and
      sighed for this shy violet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that there was something wrong in her refusal to accept the
      attentions of any of them. I knew that her inherited tastes, the examples
      all around her, and her natural regard for the wishes of her parents and
      friends, ought to have induced her to give her affections to a man worthy
      of her. I determined to find out what that obstacle was; and it was solely
      for her own good that I did so. I knew that if she married this&mdash;this
      low musician, her life would be filled with bitterness, disappointment,
      and regrets. I knew that she would soon come to be ashamed of the
      alliance. I knew&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know all that?&rdquo; came in a voice so strange, so constrained,
      so distant, that she turned in wonder toward her host. He sat looking into
      the fire, the ruddy glow of which concealed the death-like pallor that
      during the last few minutes had been deepening in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did I know it?&rdquo; she responded in surprise. &ldquo;That is a singular
      question from one who ought to be as well aware of it as I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, and she turned her head to the window and watched the
      snow steadily rebuilding the bank that her host had so recently cleared
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she remarked, with a slight sneer, &ldquo;you asked that question to
      get an argument with me, for I have heard you express romantic and
      sentimental views on the subject of love. But of one thing I am confident:
      I know that you have been a man of the world, and that you understand life
      and human nature; and I know that while men like to assume a sentimental
      attitude toward love, it is merely a pose. I will not argue the matter
      with you. You know as well as I that such a marriage would have been a
      fatal mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said this in a hard, emphatic way that indicated her desire to end the
      discussion. Then she resumed her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got into her confidence by professing sympathy with her, and adopting
      her point of view,&mdash;by anticipating it, I mean, for she was too
      guarded to disclose it. The poor little idiot fell into the trap. She had
      been carrying her secret for months, and the burden of it was wearing her
      out. You know, a nature of that kind must have sympathy, must have some
      one to listen, must have a confidant. She had not dared to trust her
      parents, for she knew that they would put a stop to her folly. When she
      found, as she thought, that I was in full sympathy with her, she laid her
      poor foolish heart completely open. And what do you think she was going to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned toward her host as she asked the question, and found him still
      sitting immovable and looking into the fire. He seemed not to have heard
      her, for he made no answer; and his stony silence and stillness gave her a
      strange sensation that might have weighed more with her had she not been
      so deeply interested in her narrative, and so well satisfied with her part
      in its happenings. She turned her glance again toward the window, and
      resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had decided to run away with this vulgar&mdash;fiddler. There was but
      one thing lacking,&mdash;he had not asked her; but she believed that he
      loved her with all his soul, and that he was having a fight with himself
      to decide whether it would be right for him to bring so scandalous a thing
      upon her. She and he both realized that it would be worse than useless for
      him to ask her parents for her. She said to me, &lsquo;He fears that I shall be
      unhappy in the poverty that would be my lot if we should go away and
      marry. He fears that I should miss the luxuries to which I had been
      accustomed. He fears that my friends will think he had married me for my
      fortune. He has so many fears, and they are all for me. Yet I know that he
      would cheerfully lay down his life for me. There never was a man so
      unselfish, so generous, so ready to sacrifice himself for others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could hardly keep from laughing while the poor child was telling me all
      that rubbish. Before employing harsh measures to check her foolish
      purpose, I resorted to milder ones. While continuing to be sympathetic, I
      nevertheless said a great many things that would have set her thinking if
      she had had any sense. I gave her to understand, as delicately as possible
      (for I was careful not to rouse any resentfulness or stubbornness in her),
      that her lover undoubtedly was a worthless fellow, as persons of his class
      are; that he was weak in character and loose in morals; that he was merely
      a sly adventurer, playing adroitly upon her innocence and confidence, and
      anxious to leave his laborious life for one of ease at her expense. I
      compared her station as his wife with that as the wife of a man in her own
      sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble was that she cared nothing for the position that she
      occupied. She honestly believed, poor idiot! that she could be as happy
      poor as rich. But the great obstacle was her infatuation for the man, and
      her belief that he was finer and better than the men of her own station.
      She was dreamy and romantic, and that is why she idealized this fiddling
      nobody. The more she told me of his gentleness, his refinement, his
      unselfishness, his poetic nature, the more I saw that he lacked the
      sterling qualities of manhood, the more I realized that he had made a
      careful study of her weaknesses and was playing upon them with all the
      unscrupulous skill of his species. She implored me to meet him, to know
      him, to study him. Of course that was out of the question. She was sure,
      she said, that I should come to admire and respect him as she had. I
      firmly declined to see him. I have even forgotten his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause in the narration. The young man was so still that his
      guest looked round at him, and found his gaze fastened upon her. She
      started, for she saw that it held a veiled quality that she did not
      understand, and that for a moment filled her with uneasiness. He quickly
      and without a word looked again at the fire.

      CHAPTER EIGHT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE convalescent
      thrust aside the momentary depression that her host&rsquo;s strange expression
      had given her, and proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last I realized that all mild measures would be useless. I knew that
      at any time something dreadful might happen, and I was determined to save
      my old schoolmate from the disgrace and sorrow that she was inviting.
      Without directly encouraging her to proceed as she had started, I gave her
      to understand that she might always depend upon my friendship. Then I set
      about the serious work that I had to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said her host, a little harshly and impatiently; and that change
      from no his habitual gentleness gave her a passing wonder. Then she saw
      that she was hurting him. She had waited for that sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that it would be an easy task to match my wit with that of a
      sentimental, scheming fiddler and a foolish girl. I needn&rsquo;t give all the
      details of the plan that I carried out. It was merely a matter of getting
      an engagement for him somewhere else for a time, and of presenting to her
      in his absence some evidence of his faithlessness. I knew them both well
      enough to foresee that she would never let him know what she had heard,&mdash;that
      she would simply send him adrift, and expect him to make an explanation if
      he was innocent, and that he would be too abashed to demand an explanation
      from her or make one himself. There was no danger that he would open a way
      to disprove or even deny the evidence that I produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this, you understand, I did with the greatest delicacy. The plan
      worked perfectly. They never saw each other again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilder turned and looked her full in the face. It was the way in which he
      did it that sharpened her attention, for it was a look in which she felt,
      rather than saw, a command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of them?&rdquo; he quietly asked, but she felt that the question
      required an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she replied, her air of indifference veiling her determination to
      hold control of the situation, &ldquo;the vagabond fiddler was never seen again.
      As for Ada&mdash;but that was infinitely better than to have lived a life
      of wretchedness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Ada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was dead in a month,&rdquo;&mdash;this with a hard and defiant manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man rose from his chair, which he clumsily upset. In a strangely
      uncertain, stumbling fashion he went to the front door, and felt for the
      latch, as though blind. Then he changed his mind and started for the rear
      door; but whatever purpose he had was interrupted by his overturning a
      small table and sending the books and other articles upon it clattering to
      the floor. Evidently startled and confused by the noise and his own
      clumsiness,&mdash;though hardly more so than the young woman, who was
      watching him in amazement,&mdash;he righted the table with difficulty, and
      began to pick up the articles that had fallen from it. Instead, however,
      of replacing them on the table, he put them on the bed. His face was
      livid, his eyes were sunk alarmingly deep in his skull, and he seemed to
      have become suddenly old and wrinkled. His hands trembled, and weakness so
      overcame him that he sat down upon the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state quickly passed, and the young man looked at his guest, who had
      been compelled to turn her chair laboriously to observe him; and when he
      saw the perplexed and distressed look in her face&mdash;seeing nothing of
      the gratification and triumph that her distress partly obscured&mdash;he
      smiled faintly and came firmly to his feet. &ldquo;It must have been an attack
      of vertigo,&rdquo; he explained, feebly. But he continued to look at her so
      steadily and with so penetrating a gaze that her uneasiness increased. Had
      she carried her torture of him too far? Oh, well, it would do him good in
      the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that steadily grew stronger and firmer, &ldquo;I
      will tell <i>you</i> a story.&rdquo; He was standing directly in front of her
      and looking down into her face. &ldquo;One day, just after a great sorrow had
      fallen upon me, I was strolling along the water-front of San Francisco,
      and sat down upon some lumber at the end of a pier. I had not noticed a
      number of rough-looking young men sitting near me, until one of them said,
      in the course of the talk that they were having, &lsquo;Yes, but I loved her! It
      was the way in which he said it that attracted my notice. I judged from
      his appearance that he was a laborer, perhaps a stevedore; but there was
      something in his voice that belongs to stricken men in all the walks of
      life. One of his companions said, &lsquo;Nonsense, Frank; there&rsquo;s just as good
      fish in the sea as ever was caught out of it.&rsquo; But Frank shook his head
      and said, &lsquo;Not for me.&rsquo; The others said nothing, and after a little while
      Frank repeated, &lsquo;Not for me.&rsquo; Did you ever hear a man say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilder&rsquo;s voice, which had been steadily growing louder, suddenly sank
      almost to a whisper as he asked his guest that question. The wrinkles were
      deepening in his face, and his glance had a sharpness of penetration that
      the young woman found it hard to meet without wincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; resumed Wilder, &ldquo;another of his companions, seeking to show him
      the folly of his grief, made some remarks about the woman that I cannot
      repeat. Frank replied without anger: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Joe: you mean well,
      but don&rsquo;t say it. She was the woman I loved. Every night, now, when I put
      out the light to go to bed, I see her in the room; and when I go on
      streets that are dark, I think she&rsquo;s walking with me. I loved that woman;
      and now I don&rsquo;t know what to do. For she&rsquo;s dead, boys, she&rsquo;s dead; and by
      God! they killed her.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilder was still looking down into the face of his guest as he concluded,
      and she had been looking up into his; but when, with a trembling voice, he
      spoke the last sentence, her glance dropped to the floor. After a pause he
      spoke again, and his voice was full, round, and passionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They killed her, madam, as they have killed many another. How it was that
      they killed the woman whose death had filled this rough man&rsquo;s life with
      grief and despair, I do not know. But they killed her. Some murderous
      human hand shattered a scheme that the Almighty himself had laid. I wish
      you could have heard him say, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s dead, boys, she&rsquo;s dead; and by God!
      they killed her.&rsquo; The sound of its agony would have found the heart that
      was intended to do more than keep you alive with its beating. Do you know
      what murder is? Do you know the difference between the gross, stupid,
      brutal murder that in satisfying its coarse lust for blood runs its thick
      neck into the halter, and the finer, daintier, infinitely more cruel
      murder that kills with torturing cruelty, and thus outwits the gallows?
      The blood-murderer is a poor fool, dwarfed in mind and crippled in soul.
      Perhaps he gets his full punishment when the law stretches his useless
      neck. But the murderer who outwits the law in his killing, who murders the
      innocent and unsuspecting and confiding, who makes friendship the cup from
      which the poison is drunk, who employs the most damnable lies and
      treachery, who calmly watches the increasing agonies of his victim as the
      poison slowly does its work,&mdash;what punishment do you think can reach
      such a murderer as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s voice had become loud, harsh, and threatening. Violent
      emotions were stirring him. His whole slender frame seemed to have
      expanded. His face was flushed, his eyes were blazing, his fingers
      clutched at invisible things, his entire aspect was menacing. His guest,
      awed and terrified, raised her glance to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by whom is such a murder done?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is done by one who,
      coming into the world with a soul fresh and complete from the hands of the
      Creator, deliberately turns aside from the way of nature and nature&rsquo;s God,
      crushes the attributes that form our one link with heaven and our one hope
      of immortality, throttles all that might be useful in bringing light and
      strength into the lives of others, and in shameless defiance of the
      Almighty&rsquo;s manifest will sets up false gods to worship, sacrifices
      self-respect for self-love, banishes the essence of life and clings to the
      dross, and wallows like swine in a mire of his own making. The
      blood-murderer is infinitely better than that. He has at least a human
      heart in all its savage majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for what is such a murder done? It proceeds from a dwarfed, distorted
      soul, deliberately, consciously, intelligently made so by its possessor.
      Its purpose is to destroy the one touch of beauty, sweetness, and purity
      that makes us akin to the angels. It sees an exquisite flower; that flower
      must be plucked, else its beauty would flourish and its destiny be
      fulfilled. It finds love in its purest, noblest, most unselfish form
      between two whom God had made each for the other for the fulfilling of his
      own inscrutable design, and by lies and treachery proceeds to kill one and
      destroy the happiness of the other. What punishment, madam, is adequate
      for such a murder? The hands of the law would be polluted by strangling a
      murderer so base, so cowardly, so infinitely lower and meaner than the
      lowest beasts, so utterly unworthy of the honor of the gallows-tree. There
      can be but one adequate punishment, and only Omnipotence could devise a
      hell sufficient for it. And the sooner this punishment comes, the sooner
      will the vengeance of God be satisfied. What higher duty could rest upon a
      mortal standing in awe and reverence under his Maker&rsquo;s law than to set the
      law in force?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the dismay and terror that now filled her soul the woman could not
      mistake the meaning of that threat, nor the madness that would give it
      force. A numbing fear, a feeling that she was sinking into a bottomless
      pit, put gyves upon all her faculties. In a hopeless stupor she sat, in
      speechless dread of the blow that she felt must fall. To her dazed
      attention the avenger himself stood before her in all the terror of
      infuriated justice free from its leash and plunging forward headlong and
      irresistible to satisfy its vengeance. Never had she dreamed that a mortal
      could face a thing so terrible as this man, who, having dragged her from
      death, and with infinite patience, gentleness, and unselfishness had been
      nursing her back to health and strength, now stood as the judge and
      executioner of her naked, trembling, convicted soul. Her eyes strained,
      her lips apart, she looked up, speechless and motionless, into his face;
      and to her his blazing eyes and tense frame filled all the world with
      vengeance, scorn, and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;whether it be murder or justice, your death would
      remove an infamous stain from the face of this fair world. If you can,
      make your peace with God, for I am going to send your damned black soul
      where it can do no further harm. It is with immeasurable hate, with
      infinite loathing, that I am going to kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clutched her shoulder, and the hot iron grip of his fingers tore her
      skin. He thrust his face close to hers, and she heard the grinding of his
      teeth, which his parted lips showed as the fangs of a maddened beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You viper!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you have no right to life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw his free hand seeking her throat. Then her energies were unlocked.
      She threw back her head, and with all her might cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! father! help me! save me!&rdquo; The young man started back, clutched
      his head with both hands, and looked about in a wild and frightened way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he breathlessly asked. &ldquo;Did you hear? The wolves are
      coming down. That was the howl of the she-wolf!&rdquo; In a dazed manner he
      found his way to the back door, opened it, passed out, and bolted it
      behind him.

      CHAPTER NINE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ORE extracts from
      the lady&rsquo;s journal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never begin an entry in my journal without having that frightful
      scene come between me and these pages. Oh, it was terrible,&mdash;terrible
      beyond all comprehension! I cannot believe, after thinking it over and
      over during these weeks that have passed since it occurred, that it was
      the fear of death that so terrified me, and, I know, made an old woman of
      me. No, it could not have been that. It was the fear of going with that
      awful condemnation upon me. Was it just? Was it true?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have recovered at last from the alarming depression that
      followed his outbreak, and this gives me leisure to think, leisure to
      recall many circumstances that in my blindness, my incredible blindness
      and stupidity, I had overlooked. I take into account the fearful strain
      under which he had suffered so long. He is a delicate, finely organized
      man, and has had more to do and to bear than a dozen strong men would have
      done and borne so well and patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was his anxiety on the score of my recovery. Then there were the
      endless duties of waiting on me, of thinking of the thousands of little
      things that had to be thought of and done, and that he never forgot nor
      neglected. He has done my cooking, my washing,&mdash;everything that was
      hard and distasteful for a man to do. Then there was his constant anxiety
      on account of the snow; and it has been growing daily all through the
      winter with the increasing dangers and discomforts; and besides his
      anxiety was the hard physical labor&mdash;far too heavy for him&mdash;that
      he has been compelled to do in order to keep our hut from being buried and
      ourselves from being smothered. And, last, there has been the constant
      wearing upon him of a close imprisonment with me, for whom I know he now
      must have a most intense dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied, too, that he has anxieties concealed from me. That they
      are associated with something upon which the back door opens, I have no
      doubt. There are several reasons for my thinking so. I am so nearly well
      now that I could get about and be helpful to him if he would only make me
      a crutch, as I have often begged him to do; but he has always put me off,
      saying that it was too early for a crutch, that my desire to be useful
      would give me a serious setback through making me overdo, and that the
      main thing for us both to consider was the return of my strength as
      quickly as possible, and our escape on snow-shoes that he would make as
      soon as I should be able to walk. It has all sounded very plausible, but
      it seems to me that common-sense would suggest that I take a little
      exercise. In spite of my having regained my flesh, I am as weak as an
      infant. Knowing that he is a good physician, I doubt his sincerity about
      the crutch. I believe the solemn truth is that he fears I would try to
      invade his cherished secret if I were able to be about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that he keeps the provisions in the place into which the back door
      opens, and that this fact seems to give him a sufficient excuse for going
      there so often,&mdash;especially as he does the cooking there; and that is
      another strange circumstance. For weeks after I was first brought to the
      hut he prepared the food on the broad hearth here; but after a while he
      did that in the rear apartment, explaining that the odors from the cooking
      were not good for me, and that it was uncomfortable for him to cook before
      an open fireplace. I protested that I did not mind the odors, and he
      replied that I would at least consider his comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing: He has not eaten with me for a long, long time. His
      original plan was to prepare my meal, wait on me until I had finished, and
      then have his own at the little table in the chimney-corner. I did not
      observe for some time that he had quit eating in that way, and that he
      took his meals in the rear apartment. He always speaks of it as an
      &lsquo;apartment,&rsquo; and not as a room. I wonder why. I have been sitting up for a
      long time now, and do not require his assistance after he has brought me
      my food. It would be much pleasanter if he would sit at the little table
      and eat with me. Is his dislike of me so deep that he cannot eat with me?
      With all my sense, I have permitted this condition of affairs to come
      about! And we both are sufferers by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no wonder, with all these things troubling him, that he has changed
      so much since I came. He is as scrupulously neat as ever, and he makes
      this poor little hut shine, but he has changed remarkably since I came. It
      has been so gradual that I didn&rsquo;t observe it until my blindness was no
      longer sufficient to keep me from seeing it. He was slender and evidently
      not strong when I came, but he has become a shadow, and his gaunt cheeks
      and hollow eyes are distressing to me. When he comes in now from fighting
      the snow,&mdash;for we must not be buried by it, and must have light and
      air, and the top of the chimney must be kept clear,&mdash;his weakness and
      exhaustion, though he tries so hard to conceal them, are terrible to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now a great fear has come to me. It is that at any moment he may
      break down and die. I wish I had not written that, I wish I had never
      thought of it. Oh, if my father would only come! What can be keeping him?
      Do I not know that he loves me better than anything else in the world? Am
      I not all that he has to love and cling to? I cannot, cannot, understand
      it. Dr. Malbone says it is unreasonable for me to expect my father, and
      that if he should make the effort to reach me now it would be at too great
      a risk to his own life. He tries to assure me that my father will be
      governed entirely by the advice of the people who know the mountains, and
      that they will restrain him from making any such attempt, as they would
      not dare to make it themselves. All that may be true, but it is difficult
      for me to believe it. If I could only get a word from him, it would give
      me greater strength to bear the horrors of my situation. But why should I
      complain, when Dr. Malbone bears it all so patiently, so sweetly, so
      cheerfully?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, that awful picture of murder comes between me and these pages
      unceasingly. I think I can understand now why men sometimes kill women.
      Why should men and women be so different? Why should it be impossible for
      them to comprehend each other? It was Murder that I saw standing before me&mdash;both
      the horrible picture of murder as he painted it, with me as the murderess&mdash;me
      as the murderess!&mdash;and Murder in the flesh as he stood ready to
      strangle me. Oh, the incredible ferocity of the man, the terrible, wild
      savagery of him, the awful dark and nether side of his strangely complex
      character! All along I had taken him for a pusillanimous milksop, a baby,
      an old woman, a weak nobody; and at once he dropped his outer shell and
      stood forth a Man,&mdash;terrible, savage, brutal, overwhelming, splendid,
      wonderful! What is my judgment worth after this? And I was so proud of my
      understanding of men!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he kill me? It was my cry that checked him; but why should it?
      Was it my appeal for help that brought him to his senses? I think so. It
      touched that within him which had been so keenly alert, so unrelaxingly
      vigilant, ever since I had come under his care. But what did he mean by
      the howl of the she-wolf? And what did he mean by saying that the wolves
      had come down? Several times since that terrible scene he has waked me in
      the night with groans, and with crying out in his sleep, &lsquo;The she-wolf?&rsquo; 
      These things have a meaning, I know. Why does he explain nothing? And why
      have I permitted an estrangement between us that makes it impossible for
      me to seek his confidence? Is it too late now?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the terrible moments, the interminable hours, that passed after he
      had left the hut by the rear door! Every second, at first, I expected him
      to return and kill me. Would he have a rifle, a revolver, a knife, or a
      bludgeon, or would he come with those terrible long fingers hooked like
      claws to fasten upon my throat? And yet, somehow, I felt safe; I felt that
      his old watchfulness and solicitude had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I could overcome the half-stupor into which his outburst had
      thrown me I dragged myself to the rear door, intending to barricade it
      against him. The effort was exceedingly painful and exhausting, and
      brought me great suffering for a week afterward. But my sufferings of mind
      and spirit were so much greater that I could bear those of the flesh. When
      I had crawled to the door and was trying to drag a box against it, I heard
      something that stopped me. I am not certain that it was anything real.
      There was a loud singing in my ears from the awful fright that I had
      suffered, and what I heard may have been that, made seemingly coherent by
      my over-strained imagination. What I heard sounded like the distant,
      smothered, awful strains of Saint-Saens&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dance of Death&rsquo; played on the
      violin. But wild and terrible as it sounded, it came as a pledge of my
      safety. Murder cannot come with music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drew myself away and with great effort clambered upon the bed, where I
      lay a long time in complete exhaustion. Time had no meaning for me. A
      dull, massive, intangible weight seemed to be crushing me, and I longed&mdash;oh,
      how I longed!&mdash;for human sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hut was dark when he returned. We had been very saving with the
      candles, for Dr. Malbone explained that they were running low; so in the
      evenings we generally had only the fire-light. There seemed to be a
      generous supply of fire-wood in the rear apartment, and some of it was a
      pitchy pine that gave out a fine blaze. When he returned the fire had
      burned out. I felt no fear when I heard him enter. I knew by the
      unsteadiness of his movements that he was weak and ill, but the first
      sound of his voice as he called me anxiously was perfectly reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am lying on the bed,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He groped to the bedside and there he knelt, and buried his face in his
      hands upon the coverlet. And then&mdash;I say it merely as his due, merely
      as the simple truth&mdash;he did the manliest thing that a man ever did.
      He raised his head and in dignified humility said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have done the most cowardly, the most brutal thing that a man can do.
      Will you forgive me? Can you forgive me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put out my hand to stop him, for it was terrible that a man should be
      so humble and broken; but he took my hand in both of his and held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Will you? Can you? he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the only time that his touch had been other than the cold and
      perfunctory one of the physician, and&mdash;I feel no shame in writing it&mdash;it
      was the first time in my life that the touch of a man&rsquo;s hand had been so
      comforting. For a moment his hand seemed to have been thrust through the
      wall that hitherto had separated us so completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You were not the one to blame,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I alone was the guilty one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; he protested, warmly. &lsquo;What provocation under heaven could
      excuse such conduct as mine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will forgive you,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;upon one condition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You forgive me in turn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very slowly, as soon as I had said that, the pressure with which he had
      been holding my hand began to relax. What did that mean, and why did he
      remain silent, and why did a pain come stealing into my heart? Could not
      he be as generous as I? Had I overrated him, after all?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was terrible!&rsquo; he half whispered. &lsquo;By every obligation resting upon a
      man, I should have been kind to you. You were my guest as well as my
      patient. You were crippled and helpless, and unable to defend yourself.
      You were a woman, looking to every man, by the right of your sex, for
      comfort and protection. I was a man, owing to you, because you were a
      woman, all the comfort and protection that every man owes to every woman.
      All of these obligations I trampled under foot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he put that sting into our reconciliation? Had he not done it so
      innocently, so unintentionally, it would not have hurt so much. I withdrew
      my hand from his very slowly; he made no effort to retain it. He did not
      again ask me to forgive him, and he did not offer me his forgiveness. The
      breach in the wall was closed, and the barrier stood intact and
      impregnable between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently he rose and made a fire, and prepared me something to eat; but
      I had no appetite. Then he found that I had a fever, and he was much
      distressed. There was just one comforting touch of sympathy when he said
      to me,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You were sobbing all the time I was making the fire and preparing your
      supper. I promise not to frighten nor distress you again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he know I had been sobbing, when I had taken so much pains to
      conceal it And yet I might have known that his watchfulness upon my
      welfare is so keen, so unrelaxing, that nothing affecting me can be hidden
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was confined to bed a week, and suffered greatly both in mind and body.
      I had hurt my crippled leg, and that made my physician very anxious.
      During all this time it had not occurred to me, so sodden with selfishness
      is my nature, that he had suffered a very serious nervous shock from his
      outburst of mad passion, and that only by a mighty effort was he holding
      up to put me again on the road to recovery. A realization of the truth
      came when my ill turn had passed. He had hardly placed me comfortably on a
      chair when a ghastly pallor made a death&rsquo;s-head of his face, and he reeled
      to the bed and fell fainting upon it, still having the thoughtfulness to
      say, as he reeled,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am&mdash;a little&mdash;tired&mdash;and sleepy. I&mdash;am perfectly&mdash;well.
      Have no&mdash;uneasiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except for his slight, short breathing, he lay for hours as one dead; and
      then I realized more fully than ever the weight of the awful burden that
      my presence has laid upon him. I know that I am killing him. O God! is
      there nothing that I can do to help him, to make it easier for him? What
      have I done that this horrible curse should have come upon me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most wonderful of all the strange things that I have seen and learned
      in this terrible imprisonment is that his kindness toward me has not
      suffered the slightest change. He is still the soul of thoughtfulness,
      watchfulness, unselfishness, and yet he has denounced me to my face as a&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing I have found: All the training that I have had in
      cleverness goes for nothing here. He always avoids the beginning of any
      conversation on subjects other than those that lie immediately near us. It
      therefore requires a great effort on my part&mdash;and I think I deserve
      some praise for it&mdash;to draw him into discussions of general matters.
      In these discussions he never advances an opinion if he suspects that I
      have an opposite one, and never opposes nor contradicts me; but I cannot
      help feeling that his views are so much broader and deeper than mine, so
      much wiser, so much more charitable, so much nearer to what he calls &lsquo;the
      great heart of humanity,&rsquo; as to make me seem shallow and mean. Am I really
      so? I try not to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With indescribable tact and delicacy, he holds me at an infinite
      distance, and I have been unable to find any way to bridge the vast
      gulf.... After all, why should I try? If he despises me, I cannot help it.
      This miserable position in which I am placed will be at an end some time;
      and when I am again free, and in my own world, I will show him the
      gratitude that I feel. Will he let me?...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there so repulsive about me? Why should I be treated as a viper?
      And why is it that of all the men I have known&mdash;men whom I could
      handle as putty&mdash;this obscure backwoods doctor sets himself wholly
      apart from me, remains utterly impregnable, shames and humiliates me with
      a veiled pity, and feels not the slightest touch of the power that I know
      myself to have? Is my face ugly? Are my manners crude? Is my voice
      repellent? Where are my resources of womanly tact that I have used
      successfully in the past? Why is it that I fail utterly to impress him as
      having a single admirable trait, a single grace of appearance, manner, or
      character?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard to bear all this. I try to be brave and strong and cheerful,
      as he always is; but it is human nature to resent his treatment, and it is
      cruel of him to keep me in such a position. It is the first time in my
      life that I have been at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine that he has suffered some great sorrow. Indeed, he said so in
      his outburst. His distrust of me seems to indicate its character. He
      probably gave some heartless woman his whole love, his whole soul, and she
      laughed at him and cast him off. That would go hard with a man of his
      kind. There can be no other explanation; and now I am the sufferer for
      that woman&rsquo;s sin: he thinks that all women are like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write this vow, so that I may turn to it often and strengthen my
      purpose by reading it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make this man like me. I will tear down the wall that he has built
      between us. I will employ every resource to bring him to my feet. I will
      make him appreciate me. I will make him need me. I will make him want me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my vow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus end, again for the present, these extracts from the lady&rsquo;s journal.

      CHAPTER TEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE severity of the
      winter did not relax. There were intervals when the wind did not blow and
      the snow did not fall; but there were neither warm winds nor sunshine to
      melt the snow, the depth of which grew steadily and aggravated the
      impassableness of the roads. Day by day, week by week, month by month it
      strengthened the bars of the prison holding the two unhappy souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the prolonged and increasing rigors of the winter harder and harder
      grew the rigors of the prison. The strength of Wilder&rsquo;s spirit was
      beginning to break down; and while it distressed his fair charge to see
      him suffer, it warmed her heart to realize that the day of her triumph was
      near,&mdash;the day when she should serve him as gently, as unselfishly,
      as faithfully as he had served her. It would be sweet to have him
      helpless, to have him lean upon her, need her, want her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her manner had undergone a great change since the terrible scene in which
      her life was threatened. Her firmness, her self-reliance, her
      aggressiveness, her condescension, all had gone, and she bore herself
      toward her rescuer as mother, sister, and friend. In innumerable little
      ways she saved him trouble through denying herself, and did it so
      tactfully that he never suspected the deception. Under the influence of
      this he had at last made her a crutch, which, though rude and
      uncomfortable, she declared to be a miracle of ease. She believed that in
      giving it to her he expressed more confidence in her than he had felt
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its introduction into the scheme of their lives worked changes that
      astonished and pleased him. In spite of his distressed protests, she
      overhauled his meagre wardrobe, and with deft workmanship put every
      article in perfect order. Her skill and ingenuity were employed in many
      other ways, so that the cabin soon took on a look very different from that
      which she had found when she came. Little touches lent an air of grace and
      a sense of comfort that the place had not borne before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She relieved him of all the work of caring for her, except that of
      cooking; this was a duty that he reserved with immovable stubbornness. Nor
      could she contrive with all her wiles and persuasion to make him have his
      meals with her. She formed many a theory to explain his conduct in that
      particular. Finally, she settled upon this one: He preferred to fill the
      rôle of a servitor; as such he must take his meals apart. But why should
      he so choose? Was it because he deemed it the safer course for them both?
      Was it because he wished to discipline her by placing her above him, when
      by obvious right they were equals? Speculation was useless; she was forced
      to accept the fact, which she did with all the grace at her command.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had grown thin to emaciation. His hands were those of a skeleton
      covered tightly with skin. His cheeks were greatly sunken, and the drawn
      skin upon his cheek-bones was a chalky white. But his eyes were the most
      haunting of his features. They seemed to be looking always for something
      that could not be found, and to show a mortal dread of a catastrophe that
      had given no sign of its imminence. In their impenetrable depths she
      imagined that she saw all mysteries, all fears, all anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though very weak, he kept sturdily and cheerfully at his duties.
      There was the snow to fight. There was the fire to be kept up, for the
      cold was intense. There was the cooking to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncomfortable as her bed was, she knew that it was luxurious in comparison
      with the thinly covered floor of stones and earth upon which he slept. In
      time this came to haunt her unceasingly, and she pondered every
      conceivable plan to make him more comfortable. At first it was her firm
      intention to make him take the bed while she slept on the floor; but she
      knew that it would be useless to make the suggestion; so she was forced to
      abandon the idea, dear as it was to her, and happy as its adoption would
      have made her. Instead, she did what she could to make his pallet
      comfortable. Her ingenuity made so great a difference that his gratitude
      touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she discovered him in agonizing pain. The torture was so great
      that it broke down his iron fortitude and drew his face awry. She was
      instantly at his side, her hand on his shoulder and her face showing a
      wistful anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my friend?&rdquo; she inquired, in the gentlest voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a pitiful effort at self-mastery he declared that it was only a
      trifling and transitory pain, and that it was rapidly passing. She knelt
      beside him and looked anxiously into his face. Her solicitude evidently
      increased his suffering, but she was determined to make the fight then and
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what it is, my friend,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the second time that she had called him &ldquo;my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only rheumatism,&rdquo; he said, somewhat impatiently, and making a
      gentle effort to push her away. But she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not a trifling thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for your strength is greatly
      reduced. Where is the pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; you are only making it harder for me!&rdquo; he petulantly
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great gladness filled her heart, for she knew that he was giving way,
      and that her solicitude was hastening his collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will make you well. Where is the pain?&rdquo; His face gave
      the glad sign of his wavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the pain?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;It is my right to know and your duty
      to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said, gasping, &ldquo;in my chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and went to the bed, which she prepared for him. When he saw what
      her intention was he came to his feet with great effort. Before she could
      divine his purpose or check him, he had gone to the rear door, hastily
      opened it, and saying, &ldquo;I will be back in a moment,&rdquo; passed out and closed
      it after him. She stood bewildered at the neatness with which he had
      baffled her, and alarmed for his safety. But he had promised to return at
      once, and she knew that he would if he could. To her great relief he soon
      came back, bearing some biscuits and a few tins of provisions. As he
      stepped within and locked the door he dropped a tin, and before she could
      go to his assistance he had fallen while trying to pick it up. She drew
      him to his feet, and was amazed to discover how much stronger she was than
      he, and yet she had thought herself very weak. She seated him upon the
      edge of the bed and began to remove his shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he gasped; &ldquo;you shall not do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she kept on and succeeded, and laid him upon the bed and drew the
      covers over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell me what to give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did so, and it gave her infinite satisfaction to have him take the
      medicine from her hand. Soon his pain relaxed, and he fell into a heavy
      slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she watched him as might a mother her slumbering first-born, her
      soul warmed and expanded, and her one shy regret was that his head was not
      resting on her breast. But there were duties awaiting her. She took up the
      surplus ashes from the hearth. She revived the fire with the wood that he
      had heaped up at the chimney-side the night before. She put snow into a
      vessel to heat water. She stowed away his pallet. She prepared to make tea
      as soon as the water should be hot. In the performance of these and other
      minor tasks she was very happy, and for the first time since she had
      entered the hut she sang softly. The work was not easy, for she had little
      strength, being unused so long to exercise, and her lameness and the
      crutch interfered sorely.
    </p>
    <p>
      One sting hurt unceasingly. She reflected that her host had decided to
      take to the bed under her persuasion, and that he had brought the
      provisions from the rear apartment so that she might prepare food during
      his helplessness; but this was because he had not trusted her to get the
      provisions herself,&mdash;had made it unnecessary for her to enter the
      forbidden chamber. As well as she could she tried to be generous; she
      tried to think that a man so kind, so thoughtful, so respectful, must have
      the best reasons for keeping her out of that room. If so, she had no right
      to expect his confidence. But why did he give her no explanation? Why
      should he not trust her to that extent? This was the sting that hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a vague way she believed that something ought to be put on his chest
      for the pain that he had suffered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had an intense desire to do something for him. She thought that cloths
      saturated with liniment would be good for him. With great caution, to
      avoid waking him, she opened the garments covering his chest. He still
      slept heavily, for the medicine that he had taken carried a soporific
      element. When she had bared his breast and seen the frightful emaciation
      of his body, she quickly covered him, fell upon her face to the floor, and
      sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day advanced, but still he slept. Her one hope now was that he would
      sleep into the night, for that would require her to sleep on the pallet
      before the hearth. She had another precious hope, and it was that they
      would at last eat a meal together; but she would rather that he slept; so,
      toward evening, she made a simple meal and ate her share alone, and kept
      his ready for him against his waking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She marvelled that there was so much to do in so small a place, and that
      the day&mdash;the sweetest, she believed, of all the days of her life&mdash;had
      passed so quickly. At short intervals she would lean over him and listen
      to his short, half-checked breathing; or she would gently lay her cool
      hand upon his hot forehead, or hold one of his burning hands in hers, and
      then press it to her cheek. It seemed surpassingly wonderful that the
      strong man, strong in spirit only, should be lying now as helpless as an
      infant, wholly dependent upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times he was restless, and talked unintelligibly in his sleep; she was
      instantly at his side, to soothe him with her cool, soft hand upon his
      face; and when she saw that it always calmed him, she sighed from the
      sweet pain that filled her breast. Once, when he seemed on the verge of
      waking, she slipped her arm under his head, and gave him more of the
      medicine, which he took unresistingly, and slept again. As the night wore
      on, she made herself unhappy with trying to choose between sitting at his
      bedside and watching, and suffering the hardship that he had borne so long
      in sleeping on the pallet. While she was in the throes of this contention,
      another urgent matter arose. It had been her host&rsquo;s custom to bring in a
      supply of wood every night. That which he had brought the night before was
      now exhausted, and more was needed. How could she get it. She knew that he
      had locked the back door and put the key into a certain pocket. She knew
      that she could not get the wood without the key. Procuring a supply of
      fuel was one precaution that he had overlooked when he had brought in a
      supply of provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a profound slumber. She could get the key, and thus provide the
      wood for the night. But would it be right to do so? If the fire went out
      the cold would be intense, and might prove fatal to him. If she should
      enter the forbidden room, would that be taking an unfair advantage of his
      helplessness? It was a hard problem, but in the end her sense of duty
      outweighed her sense of delicacy. With the greatest caution she slipped
      her hand into his pocket and secured the key. With equal caution she went
      to the door and unlocked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a great fear assailed her. What lay beyond the door? Might it not be
      some danger that only her host could safely face? If so, what could it
      be?... It were wise to have a candle; but search failed to discover one.
      She secured a small torch from the fire, and cautiously opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her surprise, no chamber was revealed, but merely a walled and roofed
      passage closed at the farther end with a door. Piled within it was a store
      of wood; there was nothing else. It was very awkward for the young woman
      to carry the crutch, the torch, and the wood all at once; it was necessary
      to relinquish the torch. She carried it back to the fireplace, and went
      again to the passage, piled some wood in her free arm, and started back.
      As she did so she saw her host sitting up and staring at her in horror.
      This so frightened her that she dropped the wood, screamed, and fell
      fainting to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she became conscious she found herself on the bed and her host
      watching beside her. There was the old look of command in his face, the
      old veil that hung between her and his confidence; and thus her glorious
      day had come to an inglorious end, and her spirit was nearly crushed. Her
      host had recovered in a measure,&mdash;sufficiently for him to resume the
      command of his house. No questions were asked, no explanations were given.
      He thanked her gratefully for her kindness to him, and thus her brief
      happiness came to an end. The old round of labor, of waiting, of hoping,
      of suffering, of imprisonment, was taken up again.

      CHAPTER ELEVEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> FEW days
      afterward they were sitting before the fire in silence. It had become
      habitual with the young woman to study every look and movement of her
      host; to anticipate him in the discharge of the household duties; to
      provide for him every little comfort that the meagre resources of the hut
      afforded; and to observe with a strange pleasure the steady breaking down
      of his will and courage. She realized that his recent attack, though so
      quickly overcome, was a warning of his approaching complete collapse; and
      she believed that only when that should happen could she hope with
      sympathy and careful nursing to save him. She welcomed the moroseness that
      was stealing over him, his growing failure to study her every want, and
      his occasional lapses into a petulant bearing toward her. It gratified her
      to see him gradually loosen the iron mask that he had worn so long. Most
      significant of all his symptoms were hallucinations that began to visit
      him. At times he would start up in violent alarm and whisper, &ldquo;Did you
      hear the howling of the wolves?&rdquo; At others he would start in alarm to
      resist an imaginary attack upon the rear door. A touch of her hand, a
      gentle, firm word, would instantly calm him, and then he would look
      foolish and ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day, as they sat before the fire, matters took a new and strange
      turn. He suddenly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so deeply absorbed in watching him and so expectant of erratic
      conduct from him that she gave no thought to the possibility of danger
      from an external source. For dreary months she had waited in this small
      prison, and no longer gave heed to any tumult without. The young man had
      been lounging in hopeless langour, but now he sat upright, every nerve,
      muscle, and faculty under extraordinary tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is coming!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I have been expecting it every day. Come&mdash;quick,
      for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying that, he seized her by the arm, and with furious eagerness and
      surprising strength dragged her to the rear door, giving her little time
      to seize her crutch. He unlocked the door and threw it open, but before he
      could open the door at the further end of the passage she heard a heavy
      roar and felt the great mountain tremble. Wholly ignorant of the meaning
      of it all, but seeing that her host was moved by an intelligent purpose,
      and feeling profound confidence and comfort in the protection that he was
      throwing about her, she placed herself completely under his guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rear door was opened, and they entered a dark, cold chamber. With
      every moment the roaring increased and the trembling of the mountain was
      augmented. Then came a tremendous, stupefying crash, and the cataclysm
      gradually died away in silence, leaving an impenetrable, oppressive
      blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two prisoners stood in breathless silence, held tightly in each
      other&rsquo;s arms. The young woman asked no questions; her sense of security
      and comfort in this man&rsquo;s arms filled the whole want of her hour. She felt
      vaguely that something more dreadful than all their past misfortunes had
      befallen them; but that feeling brought no chill to the strong warm blood
      that swept rhythmically through her heart. She was at peace with her fate.
      If this was death, it was death for them both, it was death with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her keen sympathy made her intensely attentive to every sign that he gave;
      and thus it was that she accepted, without surprise or dismay, the
      realization that he was not rallying, and that, on the contrary, he was
      sinking under the nameless blow that had fallen upon them. It was not
      anxiety for that, but for him, that now gave her every conscious quality a
      redoubled alertness. His grasp upon her tightened, and by this she knew
      that he felt the need of her, and was clinging to her. He trembled in
      every member, and swayed as he stood. With little effort she bore him to
      the ground, where, kneeling beside him and holding his hands, she softly
      spoke,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, we are together; and so long as each is the stay of the other,
      we shall have strength and courage for all things. Now tell me what I may
      do for you.&rdquo; She knew by the pressure of his hand upon hers that her words
      had found good ground. She gently pressed her advantage. &ldquo;Tell me what I
      may do for you. You are weak. You know how strong and healthy and willing
      I am; then, imagine how much pleasure it would give me to help you! You
      need a stimulant. Is there one in the cabin? Tell me where it is, and I
      will bring it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are kind,&rdquo; he said, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know what has happened?&rdquo; As he asked this question he rose to
      a sitting posture, she assisting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she calmly answered; &ldquo;but no matter what has happened, we are
      together, and thus we have strength and courage for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, hopelessly, &ldquo;but this is the end! An avalanche has buried
      us and the cabin is destroyed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terrible as was this declaration, it had no weakening effect upon his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; she cheerily asked. &ldquo;But avalanches melt away, and we have
      each other. And if it come to the very worst, we shall still have each
      other. Besides each other, we have life, and with life there is always
      hope, there is always the duty to hope. If we abandon hope, life itself is
      abandoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This worked like good wine in his veins; but she knew by the way in which
      he still clung to her, seemingly fearful that she would leave him for a
      moment, that a dreadful unknown thing sat upon him. She waited patiently
      for him to disclose it. She knew that the shock of the catastrophe had
      wholly cleared his mind, and that the old terrors which he had concealed
      from her were working upon him with renewed activity. Still he kept
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she presently said, &ldquo;that I am glad the avalanche has come?
      I understand now the dread of some terrible happening that has been
      haunting you. Well, it has come, and we are still alive; and better than
      that, we have each other. Think how much more dreadful it might have been!
      Suppose that it had come while you were outside, and swept you away.
      Suppose that it had crushed us in the cabin. But here we are, safe and
      sound, and happy each in the presence of the other.... And I am thinking
      of something else. The snow stopped falling long ago. Lately we have had
      warm winds and some rain. This must mean, my friend, that the worst is
      over. And doesn&rsquo;t it mean that the rain has softened the snow and loosened
      it to make this avalanche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden strength, a surprised gladness, were in the pressure that he now
      gave her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, it is true!&rdquo; he softly exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;the winter has dealt its last blow, and our
      liberation is at hand; for the rains that caused the avalanche will melt
      the snow that it has piled upon us, and also the snow that has closed the
      roads. It seems to me that the best of all possible things has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a childish eagerness that
      made her heart glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;how do you know that the cabin is destroyed?
      Let us go and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gentle strength and courage, the seeming soundness of her reasoning,
      and her determination not to take a gloomy view of their state, roused him
      without making him aware of his weakness. Her suggestion that the cabin
      possibly had not been destroyed was a spur to his dulled and stunned
      perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he cheerfully said; &ldquo;let us go and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still clinging closely to each other, they groped in the darkness for the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have matches, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, in confusion; &ldquo;but we can find the door without a
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was not so easy. For the first time, now that the terrors of the
      moment had passed, the young woman was nursing a happiness that she had
      not known during all the dreary weeks of their imprisonment,&mdash;except
      once, in his illness, when it had been of so short duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling thus content, she suddenly reflected that she was at last in the
      forbidden apartment, where she believed some fearful mystery was kept
      concealed from her. Their voices had been long smothered in the cramped
      hut. The contrast that she now found was startling; yet her thoughts might
      not have reverted to the fact that she was at last in the presence of the
      mystery had not Wilder&rsquo;s embarrassed refusal to make a light rekindled her
      interest. The first thing in that direction that she noticed was the
      singular resonance of their voices, as though they were in a place of a
      size just short of the echoing power. More than that, it was cold, though
      not nearly so cold as the outer air; and she heard the musical tinkle of
      dripping and running water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilder had evidently lost all idea of direction. In clinging to his
      companion as he groped, he took great care to guard her against stumbling
      and collision. His free hand (the other arm was about her waist) was
      extended. With great difficulty, increased by his eagerness, he finally
      found his bearings and advanced to the door. Slowly and cautiously they
      pushed on through the passage, and then, to their great relief, into the
      hut itself. This they found intact, but smoky and entirely dark,&mdash;the
      avalanche had smothered the chimney and shut out the light from the
      window. With matches they discovered that the window had not been broken
      and that the outer wall of the house held none of the pressure of the
      snow. In his peculiar fashion, however, Wilder began to foresee troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pressure of the mass above,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will compress the snow below,
      and thus give our window, and perhaps the outer wall of the cabin itself,
      a pressure that they can&rsquo;t bear. The hut is buried. We can have no more
      fires. The worst of all is that, having no air, we must suffocate in
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all that necessary, my friend?&rdquo; his companion asked. &ldquo;We can at least
      try to clear away the snow and thus remove all those difficulties; and
      there is a chance&mdash;and a good one, don&rsquo;t you think?&mdash;for the
      snow to melt quickly. Besides all that, we have not yet tried to dig out
      through the snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true, every word of it!&rdquo; he cried, delightedly. &ldquo;What a clear,
      strong mind you have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first compliment that he had ever paid her, and its obvious
      sincerity gave it a precious value.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she that now led the attack upon their prison of snow. What
      infinite satisfaction and pride it gave her to know that at last she was
      the guiding spirit of the hut; with what firm but gentle tact she
      overcame, one by one, his objections to her worrying or working; how she
      watched his every movement, hung upon his every word, relieved him as much
      as possible of the stress that burdened him, and ministered to his comfort
      in all ways; with what blithe songs in her heart and cheery words on her
      lips she lightened the toil of that dreadful time, need only be mentioned
      here. But it was she that led, that inspired, that achieved, and he knew
      it. This was the blessed light that shone for her through it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A search revealed loose and easily removed snow at one end of the hut,
      against the face of the cliff. His work in the lead, digging and
      tunnelling, hers in the rear, removing the snow and keeping courage in his
      heart, brought them presently to the outer air. Then, for the first time,
      they beheld the glorious sunshine, and like children they shouted in glee
      to see it. Both walls of the canon were still heavily covered with snow,
      but numerous small slides had broken it, and the rain had softened and
      ploughed it. Evidently it was rapidly melting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another scene held them as they stood hand in hand looking down into the
      canon. The great avalanche that had overwhelmed them had been arrested in
      the bottom of the canon, and had made a large lake by damming the river.
      Rapidly the lake grew in size and backed up the canon. Soon at any moment
      the growing mass of water must break through its dam, and that would be a
      spectacle to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not wait for that. With incredible labor&mdash;he no longer
      protesting against her full share in the work, and she heedless of her
      lameness and of its serious hindrance to her efforts&mdash;they together,
      hand in hand, clambered over the snow until they stood above the hut, and
      cheerily began to dig it free,&mdash;a task seemingly so far beyond their
      powers that something wonderful must have sustained them in assailing it.
      Thus they were working in the afternoon sunshine, for the first time boon
      companions, and as happy and light-hearted as children, when an
      exclamation from Wilder drew her attention to the dam. It was giving way
      under the pressure of water. Instantly she recognized a danger that he had
      overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the cliff!&rdquo; she cried, seizing his hand and dragging him away,
      &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll go down with the snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached their tunnel and the cabin in good time; but soon afterward
      the dam broke, and the swirling, thundering mass of water bore it down the
      canon. This removed the support of the snow backed up between the river
      and the top of the cliff, and it went plunging down into the water,
      leaving the top of the hut exposed, and solving the problem of the prison
      of snow.

      CHAPTER TWELVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NCE again from the
      lady&rsquo;s journal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to describe the hope, peace, and comradeship that
      have transformed this place into a little nest, where it had been so
      terrible a prison before. The sunshine outside continues, and I know that
      it is but a matter of days when my father will come. It seems
      unaccountable to me that anything in the world could have stayed him so
      long; but Dr. Mal-bone assures me that the roads and mountains are still
      utterly impassable; that the roads, besides being strewn with fallen
      trees, are in places washed away, and that our one means of escape will be
      afoot, on our own account. We are now talking it over all the time, and
      are ready to start at the first favorable moment. My leg is nearly well;
      only a slight pain after severe exertion, and a most embarrassing weakness
      there, are the trouble now. But he is putting me through excellent
      treatment and training to overcome all that; and he has given me the
      joyous promise that we shall make the start in a week from to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I must write of some other wonderful things that have happened.
      The change that has come in our mutual bearing and understanding is so
      incredible that I hardly dare put it down here, lest it prove a dream. I
      made a vow some time ago in this journal that I would make this man need
      me and want me. That victory is won. And I know that in winning it over
      him I have won it over myself. O God, how blind, how stupidly, sordidly
      blind, I have been all these years! In the depths of my wretched
      selfishness, in the dark caverns of my meanness, I had never dreamed of
      the real human heart throbbing and aching and hoping all about me; it has
      taken this strange man to drag me forth into the light. And not at all
      willingly or consciously has he done so. There is a sting in that. At
      times I hate him still when I think of it all. It was the silent,
      intangible, undirected force radiating from him that has wrought the
      change. I feel no humiliation in saying this. I say it and know it in
      spite of the great distance that separates us,&mdash;the social barriers
      that mean so little and do so much. It will remain with me forever,
      whatever happen, to have known a man; to have known him in his strength
      and weakness, in his splendid unselfishness and childish reliance; in his
      simplicity and complexity; in his singleness of purpose and variety of
      attributes; in his gentleness and ferocity, and, above all, in his
      wonderful sense of duty. But I wish he were moved by something besides
      duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another thing I must write, and I write it with a consciousness
      of burning cheeks. At times I find him&mdash;rather, I feel him&mdash;looking
      at me with a certain gentleness when I am not observing. What does that
      mean? Have I learned men so badly that I can mistake its meaning? The most
      convenient woman will do for the man who may prefer another but
      inaccessible one. Until we came closer together since the avalanche passed
      and the sunshine came, I was not a woman to him. No; I was a Duty. But
      there has now come into his voice and his glance a new quality,&mdash;stay!
      Remember that the weakness of women is their vanity. Could there happen so
      wonderful a thing as this man&rsquo;s regard for me of the kind that a woman
      wants from the man whom she worships? If so, is he too proud, too
      reserved, too conscious of his present obligation of duty and protection,
      to make it known? Does he still fear me? Does he still hold in his heart
      the frightful denunciation that he hurled at me? Does he still loathe me
      as a murderess? Is my wealth a barrier? Does he lack the courage to dare
      what every man must dare in order to secure the woman he loves?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loves? Why did I write that word? By what authority or right? And yet, of
      all the words that the sunshine of the soul has placed upon the tongue,
      that is the sweetest....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distressing things have happened since I wrote the foregoing. For a time
      the stimulation of sunshine and hope, the sure prospect of <i>my</i>
      release from this prison, worked miracles with his strength, both of body
      and mind; but three days ago he grew silent and moody, then restless and
      anxious; by night he was down with a fever, the cause of which I cannot
      understand. When I see his fleshless chest and arms, I wonder if he has
      some malady that is killing him, and that he has concealed from me. His
      drawn face, with the skin tight to breaking on his cheek-bones, and his
      extreme emaciation, look like consumption; but he has no other symptoms,
      and he declares that he is perfectly sound. Is my presence so distressing
      that it alone is killing him? If so, it is murder for me to stay longer.
      If I only knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he conceal anything from me? What could he have to conceal that
      it is not right for me to know? And yet I know that the act of concealment
      could not thus be killing him,&mdash;it is the thing he is concealing that
      has the terror. It would be infinitely better for us both if he let me
      share it, and, as I am so much stronger than he, I could bear it so much
      better; the sharing of it would lighten his burden, and my sympathy would
      give him strength. Why cannot he see all this, when it is so clear to me?
      I must be patient, patient, patient! That is my watchword now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As in the former case, when he was taken ill, so now he prepared for his
      illness by bringing in a small, but this time utterly inadequate, supply
      of provisions. Not in a single instance, down to this last attack, has he
      consented to eat with me; he has always retreated through the rear door
      and eaten alone. It is now getting hard for me to bear this singular
      tyranny about the food. He eats with me now, because, being helpless in
      bed, he cannot avoid it; but he eats so little! It is impossible for him
      to gain strength in this way, and I am distressed beyond expression. He
      simply declares that he cannot eat. Singularly enough, he is always urging
      me of late to eat little, else I shall bring on a long list of disorders
      that will prevent our escape. For that matter, there is so little left of
      the store that he brought from the rear that I am uneasy lest the supply
      be exhausted and he remain stubbornly to his purpose not to trust me to
      get more from the place behind the rear door. What will be the end of this
      dreadful situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems an odd inconsistency in his nature that this subject of eating
      should consume so much of his wandering thoughts. In his delirium he
      paints gorgeous pictures of feasts. He marvels at the splendor of Nero&rsquo;s
      banquets, and declares that the people with so much to eat must have been
      fat and content! I hate to put this down, for it seems treasonable to
      betray this touch of grossness in a nature so singularly fine. If he
      thinks so much of eating, why should he be urging me to eat sparingly of
      the rude things that his larder might afford, and that cost me so much
      effort to eat with a good grace? It is strange how many unexpected things
      we learn of others in intimate association!...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In glancing over these last pages I see how wretchedly I have failed to
      give the least insight into our life and relations. How could I ever have
      had the heart to see, much more put in writing, the slightest flaw in so
      noble a character? It would seem that the sympathy born of this new
      relation between us ought to touch only the best in my nature. Shame,
      shame, shame on me! Do I not see his haunting glance follow me everywhere,
      and resting upon me always with inexpressible gratitude?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is almost completely dependent upon me now. I nurse him as I would a
      child. It would be utterly inadequate to say that this fills me with
      happiness as being a return of some of the kindness that he has shown me.
      No, there is something besides that. The gratitude in my heart is great,&mdash;greater
      than I had thought so small and mean a heart could have. I am glad that I
      have it. But the joy of it all is the doing for this man, without regard
      to gratitude. To do for him; to nurse him; to cheer him; to feel that he
      needs me and wants me,&mdash;that is my heaven. And although a dreadful
      fear haunts me that he is dying,&mdash;that in some way that I cannot
      understand I am killing him,&mdash;that if he should die my life would be
      empty and dark,&mdash;still, it would be infinitely sweet to have him die
      in my arms, still needing me, still wanting me. Now that I have written
      that,&mdash;how could I have written it?&mdash;I will write more in all
      shamelessness. I want him to <i>say</i> that he needs me and wants me,&mdash;that
      he needs me and wants me to the end of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have written that much, I will write the rest, else my heart will
      burst. I love this man. I love him with all my heart, all my soul. I love
      him for everything that he is, not for anything that he has done. He is
      the one man whom the great God in His cruel wisdom and merciless
      providence has sent into my life for me to love. And with my tears wetting
      these pages, and my soul breathing prayers for his recovery, and his
      delivery to me, I pledge and consecrate myself to him to the end of my
      days, whatever may come. With every good impulse within me I will strive
      to be worthy of so great a heart, so noble a love. I will try to win his
      love by deserving it....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unexpected change for the better has come. Our supply of food had
      fallen so low that I had about determined to take matters into my own
      hands, enter the forbidden chamber, and get more provisions, when another
      idea occurred to me. It was absolutely necessary that we have more food.
      More important than that was the evident fact that he would die for the
      need of it if it were not forthcoming. I feared the disturbing effect of
      my going into the forbidden chamber, and so decided to make a thorough
      search of the cabin first. Knowing his inexplicable peculiarity on the
      subject of our food, I suspected that at some time in his mental wandering
      he may have concealed some in the cabin. So this morning before daylight,
      while he slept,&mdash;his sleeping is incredibly light,&mdash;I cautiously
      made a search of the cabin, and happily found a few nourishing things in
      the bottom of a box, where he had either concealed them or left them
      forgotten. These I prepared for him in a most tempting manner. I arranged
      my own dishes in a way to make him think I had eaten abundantly myself,
      and told him so when he awoke and refused to eat, urging me to eat what I
      had prepared for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I had convinced him that I had eaten all I could, he took a little,
      gingerly, from my hand. I had laid my plans well. As I fed him I talked
      incessantly, telling him a story that I knew would interest him. Before he
      realized what he was doing&mdash;his mind was not as alert as it normally
      is&mdash;he had eaten somewhat generously. The effect was magical. Color
      came to his cheeks and the quiet old sparkle to his eyes. Before long, to
      my great surprise and delight, he was up, and then went out to note the
      prospect for our leaving. He came back with a radiant face and buoyant
      manner, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My friend, we will start at sunrise to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart gave a great bound. It was a simple matter to make our
      preparations, as it was necessary that we travel as light as possible. It
      is time that we were leaving, for the last of the food that he brought
      from the rear is exhausted....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The morning has come. And now we are about to turn our backs upon this
      strange place of suffering and mystery, its suffering endured, its mystery
      unsolved. And without shame do I say that I would rather walk out thus,
      and face the perils that lie ahead, with this man as my guide, my
      protector, my friend, than go forth in all the stateliness and triumph
      that wealth could afford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, dear, dear little home, my refuge, my cradle, my hope. I will
      come back, and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is calling me at the door. I must kiss this table, these chairs, that
      bed, the walls. But it is with Him that I go.&rdquo; Thus closed the lady&rsquo;s
      journal.

      CHAPTER THIRTEEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE two started
      bravely in the fine morning sunshine. There were long and laborious miles
      ahead, and only a short day in which to overcome them and their
      difficulties. In his heart the young man believed that it would be
      impossible for them to complete the task that day, and he dreaded the
      shelterless night that would overtake them. But should he break down, the
      day&rsquo;s work would have hardened his companion for the rest of the journey
      alone. There was a chance that they would find help on the way, for surely
      efforts would be making to clear the roads. The snow had disappeared from
      all exposed places.
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended the shaly, slippery trail to the road, and here he was
      gratified to see that the avalanche had cleared away the fallen tree and
      the wreck of the wagon. He led the way up the canon, for in that direction
      were the nearest houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the road even worse than he had expected. Being a narrow way, cut
      into the steep slope of the canon, to leave it in rounding fallen trees
      and breaches left by the storm was a slow and laborious task, and time was
      precious for a number of reasons. Each had a load to bear,&mdash;he some
      covering against the night, and she some articles of her own. These soon
      became very burdensome to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they plodded. While a heaviness appeared in his manner, her bearing was
      cheerful and spirited. A sadness that he made no effort to conceal and
      that she bravely hid oppressed them both. To find him sad was sufficient
      to tinge her sadness with happiness. They rested at short intervals, for
      the exertion soon began to tell upon them, but upon him the more. They
      slaked their thirst from the river. To the woman it seemed a spring-time
      stroll through flowering fields, softened by the sweet sadness of May. To
      him it was a task that brought them step by step nearer to the end, where
      he must deal her the crudest blow of her life. For at the end she expected
      news of her father. She would hear it, and from the one who would have
      been the most glad to spare her. But she must not know yet. All her
      strength was needed for the task before her. It is time to break hearts
      when their breaking can be no longer deferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been trudging ahead. He must have suspected that she observed the
      labor with which he walked, the uncontrollable tendency of his knees to
      give way, the reeling that now would send him against the bank, and then
      upon the outer edge of the grade; for presently he asked her to walk
      ahead. She complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their slow and laborious work presently made it impossible for them to
      talk. They went on in silence. After they had proceeded thus for some
      hours, a thing occurred that struck dismay to her soul. Her companion
      suddenly became voluble. At first he was coherent, although he talked
      about matters to which she was a total stranger. This showed an alarming
      unconsciousness of her presence. As he talked, he became more and more
      incoherent, and at times laughed inanely. Presently, with awe in his
      voice, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was the woman I loved. She&rsquo;s dead, boys, she&rsquo;s dead; and by God! they
      killed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her spirit sank. After all that she had hoped and yearned for, there now
      had come back the most terrible of the ghosts of the bitter past. After
      all the seeming bridging of the chasm that had separated them, it opened
      now all the wider and deeper and darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what a murderer is?&rdquo; he exclaimed in a loud voice, as he
      swung his arm threateningly aloft. &ldquo;A she-wolf, the slyest and most
      dangerous of beasts. She comes whining and fawning; she licks your hand;
      she wins your trust. And then, when you have warmed her, and patched her
      torn skin, and mended her broken bones, she turns upon you and tears out
      your heart with her fangs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stifling, faint, barely able to stand, the young woman stood aside, and he
      passed her without seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he resumed in great excitement, &ldquo;I must be a man,&mdash;always a
      man. What! kill a woman? No, no, no! Not that. That would be terrible,
      brutal, cowardly. Yes, I must be a man. She needs me; I will help her. Is
      that door locked? She must never know&mdash;never know so long as she
      lives. Ah, that is beautiful, wonderful, savory,&mdash;a feast for gods
      and angels! Yes, I will do my duty. She needs me. She despises me. Very
      good; I will do my duty. She scorns my poor food&mdash;secretly, but I
      know! She is getting well. Thank God for that! She shall eat all she can.
      Me? No, no. I don&rsquo;t want anything. No; I don&rsquo;t want a thing. I have no
      appetite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst into laughter, and the echo of it came back from the opposite
      wall of the canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my love, my love!&rdquo; he cried, suddenly becoming sad, &ldquo;how could you
      cast me off, when all had been so true and trusting between us? But I know
      it was better so. It was not right for me to stand in the way.&rdquo; He paused,
      and his voice sank into an awed whisper as he said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead, boys,
      she&rsquo;s dead; and by God! they killed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed rapidly on, muttering things that she could not hear, that she
      did not want to hear. Not a word of kindness for her had come from him in
      his delirium, and her heart was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it is all over,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;I will go to my old friend, and he
      will nurse me back to health and strength, and I will begin the fight
      again. I will be a man&mdash;always a man. I will do my duty. And the
      she-wolf&mdash;no, no, no! She will not tear out my heart with her claws
      and fangs. No! There is no she-wolf! I say, there is no she-wolf. No! She
      is kind to me. I know it, I know it! She is gentle and thoughtful and
      unselfish. She is very, very beautiful. She won&rsquo;t leave me, will she? She
      won&rsquo;t leave me alone! But she is unmanning me! I must not let her do that!
      I must be a man and do my duty. No, you must not take off my shoes. I can
      do that. I have no pain&mdash;none whatever. Yes, I will be calm. Your
      voice is sweet; it is music; it fills me with peace and comfort; and your
      hand on my face&mdash;how soft and pleasant it is! I wish I could tell
      you; but no, I must do my duty; I must be a man! I will not listen to your
      voice. I will not let you touch me. That would keep me from my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words raised her from despair to bliss. And so he had fought his
      inclinations,&mdash;he needed her, he wanted her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he kept on. She strained every hearing faculty for his slightest
      word. For what he had already said, she could bear his forgetting her
      presence. Still they pushed on, he muttering and laughing; but for all his
      madness, he was wise and cautious amid the dangers and hardships of the
      road. No longer did he advise her, guide her, assist her, and show her the
      innumerable unobtrusive attentions to which she had become accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he suddenly stopped in a stretch of good road and looked about,
      bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this?&rdquo; he whispered; then aloud, &ldquo;Oh, it is the trail of the
      wolves! After them will come the she-wolf, and her fangs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      dropped his parcel and clutched his breast. &ldquo;Her fangs!&rdquo; he gasped. He
      looked about and picked up a stick, which he swung as a club about him.
      &ldquo;The she-wolf is here!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance fell upon his companion, standing in awe and pity and love
      before him. Instantly a fearful malignity hardened his face, and his eyes
      blazed with the murder that had filled them once before. He clutched the
      stick more fiercely, and glared at her with a mixture of terror and
      ferocity. But she stood firm, and gently said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face instantly softened. She stood smiling, her glance caressing, her
      whole bearing bespeaking sympathy and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; she said, in a voice whose sweetness sank deep within
      him, &ldquo;you know me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of joyous recognition swept over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad!&rdquo; he breathlessly said. &ldquo;I thought you had left me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he sank to the ground, smiling upon her as he fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt beside him, placed a soothing hand upon his cheek, and spoke
      comforting words. His face showed the profound gratification that filled
      him, and her soul spread its wings in the sunshine that filled the day
      with its glories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay limp and helpless, but she knew that he must be going forward if he
      could. She caressed him, she coaxed him, she raised him to a sitting
      posture, she put her arms under his and lifted him to his feet; but his
      breathing was short and distressed, his head rolled listlessly, and his
      legs refused their offices. Then she realized that the last remnant of his
      strength, both of body and spirit, was gone; and her heart sank to the
      uttermost depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay me down,&rdquo; he said, very gently, but clearly, and with perfect
      resignation. &ldquo;Lay me down, my friend, and go on alone. I am very tired,
      and must sleep. Keep to the road. I don&rsquo;t think it is far to the nearest
      house. You are sure to find some one. Be brave and keep on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid him down and turned away. A cruel choking had throttled her power
      of speech. With tears so streaming from her eyes that she went about her
      purpose half blind, she found a drier place in the road, gathered
      pine-needles less soaked than the rest, made a bed for him there, and
      spread upon it the blankets that he had been carrying. When she looked
      again into his face he was sleeping lightly, and his breathing betrayed
      great physical distress. As gently as a mother lifting her sleeping babe,
      she took him up in her arms, bore him to the bed, and with infinite care
      and tenderness laid him upon it. Then with some twigs and handkerchiefs
      she fashioned a canopy that shielded his head from the sun. She covered
      him with a free part of the blanket; but fearing that it would prove
      insufficient, she removed her outer skirt and covered him with that; these
      covers she tucked about him, that he might not easily throw them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been roused by these attentions. She knelt beside him and
      gently kissed his hands, his cheeks, his forehead, his lips, and wiped
      away her streaming tears as they fell upon his face. He moved slightly,
      opened his eyes, looked into her face, and smiled. Very feebly he took her
      hand, brought it to his lips, kissed it, smiled again, closed his eyes,
      and with a sigh of weariness fell asleep. She knelt thus and watched him
      for a little while, seeing him sink deeper and deeper into slumber. Then
      she rose. And now may the great God give heart and strength for the mighty
      task ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not trusting herself to look back upon him, she gathered up her courage
      and started. On she went, her head high, her eyes aflame, her cheeks
      aglow. A suffocating, heart-aching loneliness haunted her, dogged her,
      gnawed at her spirit. More than once she wavered, weak and trembling,
      under the backward strain upon her heart-strings. More than once she cried
      aloud, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave him! I can&rsquo;t leave him! I must go back!&rdquo; And then
      she would summon all her strength again, and cry, &ldquo;It is for his sake that
      I go! It is to save him that I leave him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, rended by contending agonies, she went on and on. With incredible
      self-torturings she pictured the dangers to which she had left him
      exposed. What had he meant by the wolves? Was there really danger from
      that source? Often in his sleep in the hut, and again when his mind would
      wander, he had spoken of the wolves, and always in terror; but most
      dreadful of all things to him was the she-wolf. Yet during all the time
      that she had been imprisoned with him in the hut there had not been the
      least sign of a wolf, not the most distant howl of one. Why had this
      hallucination been so persistent with him, so terrifying to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      The miles seemed interminable. She kept her eyes and ears strained for
      signs and sounds of human life. At intervals she would call aloud with all
      her might, and after hearing the echo of her voice die away in the canon,
      wait breathlessly for a response that never came. With eager haste she
      pushed on. Clambering over fallen trees, heading gullies that she could
      not leap, wading swift rivulets with which the rapidly melting snow was
      still ploughing the road, she came at length within view of some men who
      were clearing the road with axes and mending it with shovels,&mdash;the
      rough, strong, silent, capable men of the mountains. She frantically waved
      her handkerchief and called as she went. They stopped their work and stood
      gazing at her in wondering silence. They saw that she was not of their
      kind; but their trained sensibilities informed them that the great
      mountains had been working their terrible will upon human helplessness,
      and they stood ready to put the strength of their arms and hearts into the
      human struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperfectly clad as she was, her form and bearing suggesting a princess,
      her beauty, enhanced by her joy at finding help, radiant and dazzling,
      their wonder and shyness held them stolid and outwardly unresponsive, and
      they silently waited for her to speak. She went straight to them, and,
      looking at them one after another as she spoke, she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you help me, men? I left a man exhausted in the road some miles down
      the canon. I fear he is dying. Will you go with me and help me bring him
      up? Is there a doctor anywhere near? Is there a house to which we may take
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of silence,&mdash;these men are slow, but all the surer
      for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them, a bearded, commanding man of middle age, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we will go and bring him up. A doctor lives up the canon. Maybe he&rsquo;s
      at home. The man can&rsquo;t walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is lying helpless in the road.&rdquo; The strong man, whom she afterward
      heard the others call Samson,&mdash;one of those singular coincidences of
      name and character,&mdash;turned and picked out two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two,&rdquo; he said, as quietly as though he were directing the road-work,
      &ldquo;cut two poles and make a litter with them and a blanket. Go and bring the
      man up. You,&rdquo; he said to a third, &ldquo;help them make the litter, and give a
      hand on the trip.&rdquo; Two others he directed to prepare the wagon, which
      stood a short distance up the road. Another he sent up the road to summon
      the doctor. Then he turned his attention to the young woman. Without
      consulting her, he made a comfortable nest of greatcoats and blankets, and
      when he had so deftly and quickly finished it, he said to her,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and rest here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she vehemently protested; &ldquo;I am going back with the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going back with the men. If you did, there would be two for
      them to bring up instead of one. One is enough. Make yourself comfortable
      here; you are safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slight rebuke in this, and the quiet determination with which the man
      spoke, informed her that she must lay a reasoning hand upon her agonizing
      fear and impatience. She obeyed him with as good a grace as she could
      find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again without consulting her, he brought some hot coffee, poured it into a
      tin-cup, and held it out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drank it. He then produced some bread, which he sliced and buttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed. While doing so she watched the men make the litter, and
      marvelled at the skill with which they worked, and the quickness with
      which the task was done, seemingly without the slightest effort or hurry.
      Then in silence the three men swung down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man named Samson, although he had not appeared to be giving any
      attention to his fair guest, was in front of her the moment she had
      finished the bread and butter. He carried some things in his arms, and
      threw them down at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off your shoes and stockings,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and put on these socks;
      they are thick and warm. Take off all your other things that are wet, and
      wrap yourself up in these blankets. By the time the litter comes your
      things will be dry in the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER FOURTEEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE three remaining
      men turned to their work of clearing the road, headed by Samson. He had
      not asked her any questions; he did not even look again her way; but
      presently he brought her clothes, which he had spread and dried in the
      sunshine, and told her that by the time she was dressed the litter would
      be there. This she found to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming down the road, on a powerful horse, she saw a bearded, ruddy-faced,
      stocky, middle-aged man, whose business she easily guessed from the
      country-doctor&rsquo;s saddle-bags slung across his horse. The doctor rode up
      and greeted,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Samson! Man hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a jerk of his thumb toward his guest, he added, &ldquo;She can tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had not seen her. He looked around, gazed at her a moment in
      astonishment, and then, with a fine courtesy singularly different from the
      hearty roughness with which he had greeted the man, he raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This diversion had kept the attention of the two from the quiet arrival of
      the men with the litter. When the young woman saw it, she forgot the
      presence of all save him lying so quiet where the men had placed him on a
      bed made by Samson from coats. She ran and knelt beside him; she kissed
      his cheeks; she chafed his hands; she begged him to speak, to live for her
      sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong hand of the doctor lifted her from the unconscious man and
      gently put her aside. A moment&rsquo;s astonished gaze into the pallid, upturned
      face brought this burst from the doctor,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrian Wilder&mdash;dying!&rdquo; He turned anxiously upon the young woman, and
      demanded, &ldquo;Where did you find him? What is the matter here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake,&rdquo; she firmly said. &ldquo;He is Dr. Malbone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Malbone!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, I am Dr. Malbone. This man is my
      friend, Adrian Wilder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His look was half fierce and full of suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too surprised to comprehend at once the full meaning of his declaration,
      she stood staring at the physician in silence. That gentleman, turning
      from her, dropped on his knees and made a hurried examination of the
      unconscious man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this,&rdquo; he said to himself. He quickly
      opened Wilder&rsquo;s shirt. Upon seeing the emaciation there, and exclaiming in
      amazement and horror, he turned again upon the young woman as he knelt,
      and demanded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain this to me. Be quick, for every moment is precious. I don&rsquo;t want
      to make a mistake, and I must know. He has pneumonia; but there is
      something behind it. Where and when did you find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few words she told the salient facts of the story as she believed it,&mdash;the
      running away of the horses, the breaking of her leg, her father&rsquo;s
      departure to fetch relief, her care at the stone hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did this accident happen to you?&rdquo; the doctor asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you two have lived alone at his cabin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced her over, and looked more puzzled than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking hearty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;how is it that my friend is in this
      condition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been his care of me and his worry on my account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This appeared half to satisfy Dr. Mal-bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not being a doctor, and being extremely susceptible to
      the pressure of his duty toward you, he may have worn himself out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he hastily gave the young man a stimulant, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fall to here, men, and help me revive him, else he will be dead before we
      know it. Chafe his wrists and ankles. Hurry, men, but be gentle. That is
      good. Slow, there, John; those horny hands of yours are strong and rough.
      Samson, bring some strong coffee as quickly as God will let you. Rub him
      under the blankets, men; don&rsquo;t let him chill. Maybe we can get him out of
      this pinch. The great thing now is to take him to my house.... Ah, that is
      good work, lads! His heart is waking up a little. That is good. That is
      very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Malbone straightened up, and turned to the young woman, again
      fastening upon her the strange, severe, suspicious, half-threatening look
      that she had already learned to dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear there is something unexplained here, madam, something concealed. I
      am not accusing you. My friend is a strange, fine man, and for good
      reasons he may have withheld something from you. But he would never hide
      anything from me. Did he give you a letter for any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martin, hand me his coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Malbone searched the pockets, and found a sealed letter addressed to
      him. He tore it open and read. As he read his astonishment grew. When he
      had finished, he turned a strange, pitying look upon the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He charges me to give you this when I shall have read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed her the letter, which she read. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Friend,&mdash;This is written to give Miss Andros some unhappy
      information that she ought to have at the earliest safe and proper moment,
      and as a precaution against my breaking down before that moment arrives.
      To have told her at first might have prevented her recovery. The proper
      moment to tell her will have arrived when she is in safe hands. I trust
      that they may be yours, and I know that you will show her every kindness
      that your generous soul can yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this: Her father lost his life in the accident on the grade, by the
      falling of a tree upon him. His body rests under the earth in the farther
      end of the cave into which the rear door of my cabin opens. The grave is
      marked with a board giving his name. Nailed up in a box near the door are
      his personal effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give this letter to my afflicted friend. It will convey no hint of the
      profound sympathy that I feel, nor of what I suffer in thus raising my
      hand to deal her so cruel a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only crave her forgiveness for deceiving her both as to her
      father&rsquo;s death and my being a physician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eager hope, the anxiety, the absorption of her entire self in the
      stricken man at her feet, fled before the crushing whirlwind of grief that
      now overwhelmed her. The loss of her father was the loss of the anchor of
      her life, the loss of the one sure thing upon which her soul rested, in
      which she knew peace, security, sympathy, and strength. She spoke no word,
      but gazed far down the canon, a picture of complete desolation. Dr.
      Malbone stood beside her, looking down thoughtfully into the face of his
      friend. The men, relieved from their work of bringing back a faint glow of
      the flickering life on the ground, moved away silently, with the
      instinctive delicacy of their kind, knowing that they were facing a
      tragedy that they did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter fell from the young woman&rsquo;s hand as she still gazed in mute
      agony down the canon. A slight swaying of her form warned Dr. Malbone that
      his time for action had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A noble life still is left to us,&rdquo; he quietly said, without looking up,
      and with a certain unsteadiness in his voice; &ldquo;and it appeals to us for
      all that we have to give of help and strength and sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a timely word. Instantly she dragged herself out of the crushing
      tumult into which she had been plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, radiant with love and towering above the wreck that
      encompassed her, &ldquo;the noblest of all lives is still left to us, and it
      shall have all that lies in us to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Dr. Malbone, &ldquo;time is very precious. Let us take him to my
      home at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set behind the western mountains, but it still tipped the
      snowy summit of Mount Shasta with a crimson glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put the horses through,&rdquo; said Dr. Malbone to the man who drove.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made good speed up the grade, Dr. Malbone pondering in silence some
      problem that still sorely troubled him, the young woman sitting on the
      floor of the wagon and holding the hand of the unconscious man. Presently
      they arrived at Dr. Malbone&rsquo;s house, where his plain, homelike wife, a
      competent mountain woman, quickly had the patient comfortable in bed,
      while her husband went thoroughly into the treatment. His was a mercurial
      spirit, the opposite of the gentle soul now seemingly passing away under
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can find absolutely nothing,&rdquo; he finally exclaimed, in despair, &ldquo;except
      simple inanition as the probable cause and a complication of this attack,
      and I know that it is absurd. You must help me, madam. Tell me how you
      lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Numerous sharp questions were required before he finally came upon the
      trail of the truth. She had delayed saying that Wilder had not eaten with
      her, and that toward the last he was niggardly with the food, because she
      feared that it would sound like a reproach. The moment she mentioned it,
      Dr. Mal-bone was transfigured. He sprang back from the bedside and
      confronted her, menacing and formidable, as Wilder had confronted her on
      that terrible day when she told him the story of her breaking up the
      attachment between a musician and her friend, and the death of the girl
      from a broken heart. What had she done or said that should bring this
      second storm of a man&rsquo;s fury upon her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you no doubt think,&rdquo; cried Dr. Malbone, &ldquo;that you have learned from
      his letter the true reason for his keeping you out of the cave. In all
      this broad world is there any human being so besotted with selfishness as
      not to be able to burrow through its swinishness for the truth? Come and
      look at this.&rdquo; He dragged her to the bedside and showed her the body of
      his patient. &ldquo;Is there under heaven,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;a mental or a
      spiritual eye so blinded with brutal egotism, so drunk with self-interest,
      as not to read the story that this poor withered frame writes large? Do
      you not understand that in those acts&mdash;over which you no doubt whined
      and complained in your empty heart&mdash;he gave evidence of a sublime
      sacrifice for you? Look at your own abundant flesh. You never went hungry
      in the hut. You never asked yourself if he might have food sufficient for
      two during the long winter. And now you see that he has denied himself for
      your comfort. He is dying of starvation, because in his splendid
      unselfishness he wanted you to be comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Malbone paused, but his eyes were still blazing upon her, and his body
      trembled with the passion that stirred him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One affliction has fallen upon you; may you have strength and grace to
      bear it; but I say this: If ten thousand such afflictions had overtaken
      you, the suffering from them would not be adequate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly checked himself, and gave his wife hurried instructions for
      the preparation of some nutriment. While this was preparing, he resorted
      to such vigorous measures as the urgency of the case demanded. All this
      quickly brought him under self-control, and he worked with the sure hand
      of a skilful man battling with all his might in a desperate emergency. The
      young woman had sunk into a chair, where she sat dazed, weak, ill, and
      ignored, not daring to offer help, and praying dumbly for the opening of a
      vast gulf to entomb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patient rallied under the physician&rsquo;s treatment. Slowly, but with
      palpable effect, Dr. Malbone dragged him a little way from the brink of
      death. The doctor&rsquo;s coat was off, but sweat streamed down his face. His
      wife&mdash;silent, intelligent, and alert&mdash;gave him all the help that
      he required, and neither of them looked toward the suffering woman sitting
      crushed and miserable in the chair. Thus the time passed until the intense
      anxiety in the physician&rsquo;s face began to relax; and at last, with a sigh,
      he sank wearily into a chair, remarking to his wife,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing more to do for the present. He is rallying. Give him
      time. The chances are a hundred to one against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rested his head on the back of his chair and closed his eyes, while his
      wife went to discharge her duties in another part of the house. Soon he
      raised his head, and in his old kindly manner said to the young woman,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for the way in which I talked just now, and I ask you to
      forgive me. You will understand my outburst and be more inclined to
      forgive me when I tell you something of my poor friend&rsquo;s life; for I am
      certain that he has told you nothing. Has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, weakly and humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has suffered so cruel a wrong in the past that when I see the least
      approach to imposition upon his noble unselfishness it maddens me. I ought
      not to have blamed you. You were not conscious of imposing upon him. I
      believe that he is dying. If so, there will be no harm in my telling you
      his story. If he lives, I can trust you with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had known him in San Francisco, but I came to these mountains long
      before him. It was less than two years ago that he came to me, and you can
      never realize the shock that his condition gave me. After a while he told
      me of his trouble as he understood it. It was this: Through giving violin
      lessons to a young lady of wealth and of great loveliness of character, he
      became deeply attached to her, and in return she gave him her whole
      affection. She was willing and anxious to marry him, even though she knew
      that her parents and friends would disown her if she did. He hesitated,
      from pure unselfishness, to bring upon her any distress that their
      marriage might cause. The poor fool could not understand that she would
      have gladly given up everything in life for him. He was called away to
      fill a lucrative engagement, and in his absence her heart changed toward
      him. Soon afterward she died. When he came to me he was broken in spirit
      and body, and it was my privilege to start him aright in a chastened and
      nobler life. He and I built the cabin, and there he was to pass the winter
      in unremitting study and self-mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the story as he told it to me and as he believed it to be. But I
      saw that something was behind it that in his sweetness and generosity he
      had never suspected. I myself learned the truth. By means of a few
      inquiries made by letter to a friend in San Francisco, I found that an old
      school-friend of the girl had made the trouble. It was a case of malicious
      revenge. The girl whom my friend loved had innocently and unconsciously
      received the love of a man for whom she cared nothing, as her whole
      affection was with my friend. This man was very rich, and for that and
      other reasons was regarded as a prize. It appears that before losing his
      heart to this loveliest of girls he had been devoted to her old
      school-friend, a beautiful and dashing belle, who expected to marry him.
      When she found that she had lost him, she planned revenge. She was utterly
      without heart or principle. So she traded on her old school-mate&rsquo;s
      confidence in her, and used that friendship to separate the lovers with
      lies and cunning. She succeeded. The girl died of a broken heart, and my
      friend&rsquo;s life was ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of unutterable horror settled upon the young woman&rsquo;s face, and she
      sat upright and rigid, staring helplessly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never told him what I had learned,&rdquo; resumed the physician. &ldquo;It might
      have broken his heart, and he had suffered enough. I did not want him to
      know that malice, revenge, and murder had played their part in his story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman&rsquo;s face bore so singular an expression that the physician
      marvelled. She was white, and deep and unaccustomed lines marred her
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows the whole truth,&rdquo; she said, quietly, and with a strange
      hardness. &ldquo;He knows that I am the woman who brought about their
      separation. He learned it from me long ago in his cabin.&rdquo; What Dr. Malbone
      might have done under the spur of the horror and amazement that filled him
      was checked by a violent fit of coughing with which his patient had been
      seized. His physician&rsquo;s training instantly sent him to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me here!&rdquo; he cried, as he raised the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman staggered to the bed. Dr. Malbone shot a malevolent glance
      at her, but she did not heed it. He raised his hand to thrust her back,
      but she grasped it, and quietly and firmly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yielded, and told her what to do, and she did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cough was checked, and the sufferer was laid back upon the pillow. His
      eyes were open, and he looked from one of the watchers to the other as
      they stood on opposite sides of the bed. At first he was puzzled, and then
      a bright look of recognition lighted up his face. He smiled as he extended
      a feeble hand to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are safe,&rdquo; he faintly said to the young woman. &ldquo;I am glad. Dr.
      Mal-bone will be kind to you.&rdquo; To the physician he said, his voice
      tremulous with affection, &ldquo;My dear old friend, always true, always kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to say more, but Dr. Mal-bone checked him and gave him something
      to strengthen him. He took it, shaking his head and smiling sadly.
      Presently, as his eyes grew brighter, Dr. Malbone said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may speak now, Adrian, if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman had knelt, and, taking the sufferer&rsquo;s hand in both of
      hers, bowed her head over it as she pressed it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head, and they looked long and silently at each other. He
      seemed troubled and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have not yet learned. Dr. Malbone&mdash;a
      letter&mdash;my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read the letter, my friend,&rdquo; she hastened to say. &ldquo;I know all
      about my father, and I know how thoughtful and kind you were not to tell
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you forgive me?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you, my friend? Yes, a thousand times; but how can you forgive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She buried her face in his pillow; her arm stole round him, and she drew
      him against her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did that long ago,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My noble, generous friend!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But can you understand what you
      have been to me, what you have done for me, what you are to me? Can you
      believe that you have made a true woman of me? Am I still the she-wolf, my
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A supreme agony moved her in this appeal. He feebly tried to check her
      with his hand, but she nestled her cheek close against his and pleaded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand that you have made me worthy of every kind regard that
      so noble a man could have for a woman? Can you believe, friend of my life,
      that you have made me such a woman as would be perfect in your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, and, still holding him in her arms, she raised her head
      to look into his face. He was regarding her with a strange and distant
      wistfulness, and there shone in his eyes a pale, far light that stretched
      through infinite space. A faint smile played upon his lips, the feeble
      pressure of his hand closed upon hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not leave me, will you?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;You will come back to
      health, my friend. You will teach me, you will guide me. The world will be
      bright and beautiful, for all our suffering has been borne. We belong each
      to the other, my friend, in friendship, trust, and sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still he smiled as he looked into her face; and as he smiled, and she saw
      the strange, far light that shone from so inconceivable a distance in the
      awful depths of his eyes, her eager heart found a bridge of glass spanning
      the gulf between them. Then he sighed deeply, and his eyes rolled upward.
      She sprang from the bed to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Malbone!&rdquo; she cried, in a suppressed voice, &ldquo;quick! he has fainted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician, who had stepped a little way apart, came forward and looked
      down into the still face of his friend. Then he glanced up at the young
      woman, who was trembling with eager impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to do,&rdquo; sadly replied Dr. Malbone; then he passed round
      the bed, took the young woman gently by the arm, and, in a kind voice,
      said, &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went with him, wondering, and looking over her shoulder toward the
      bed. He led her into an adjoining room, closed the door, and placed a
      chair for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dr. Malbone!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;How can I, when he needs us both so
      much? Hurry back to him; I will stay here if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the physician; &ldquo;my place is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of desperate eagerness settled in her face, and she was listening
      intently for a sound from the other room. The physician regarded her
      pityingly, as she stood trembling in an agony of impatience and
      apprehension. Unable to control herself longer, she seized him by the arm,
      and cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Malbone, you know best, but I can&rsquo;t bear to leave him! Do you know
      that I fear he will die? He is all the world to me, and I can&rsquo;t bear to
      let him go. Do you understand that? I want him to live. I want to show him
      what a good woman&rsquo;s trust and love can be. I want to give my whole life to
      his happiness. I want to atone for all the evil and suffering that I have
      brought upon him. I want him to know that he has found peace and a refuge
      at last. Dr. Malbone, go and save him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Malbone took her hands in his, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try to understand what I am going to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then command all the strength of your soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Malbone!&rdquo; she gasped, peering into his eyes, her face blanching.
    </p>
    <p>
      With pity and tenderness the physician said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend is dead; he died in your arms.&rdquo;
     </p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
